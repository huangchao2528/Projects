# Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes

## Overview
This repository contains the work I completed for the Kaggle competition titled "Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes." The goal of this competition was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting various outcomes in patients with cirrhosis based on clinical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this competition includes clinical parameters of patients diagnosed with cirrhosis.

## Files in the Repository
- `prediction-of-Cirrhosis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
- `train.csv`: Training data set containing features and target variable.
- `test.csv`: Test data set used for making predictions.
- `submission.csv`: Predictions generated by the model, formatted for Kaggle submission.

## Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** An in-depth analysis was conducted to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques like [mention any feature engineering techniques used] were employed to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Pycarete was used to compare different models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy and weighted f1-score.

## Results
Got a score of 0.43567 in my first attempt.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, pycaret, xgboost, lightgbm
