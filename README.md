# Chao (Eric) Huang's Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my data science and machine learning portfolio! This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning across various domains. Each project is a unique exploration into a specific dataset or challenge, demonstrating my approach to solving real-world problems using data.

## Projects Overview

### [XInsurance - LTV Prediction](https://github.com/huangchao2528/Projects/tree/8d7c7b190114b833837ffd3623c20d497290f333/XInsurance%20-%20LTV%20Prediction)
Predicting the Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers for an insurance company using data science methodologies. This project involves data importation, exploration, cleaning, and predictive modeling.

### [Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis](https://github.com/huangchao2528/Projects/tree/c5250ebde88246644a6afaae520540ad79139b97/Iowa%20Liquor%20Sales)
An analysis of liquor sales in Iowa using Python and Power BI. This project focuses on deriving trends and patterns from sales data to guide personal purchase decisions.

### [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/huangchao2528/Projects/tree/c5250ebde88246644a6afaae520540ad79139b97/House-Prices%20Prediction)
A Kaggle competition project aimed at predicting the sales prices of houses. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

### [Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes](https://github.com/huangchao2528/Projects/tree/c5250ebde88246644a6afaae520540ad79139b97/Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Cirrhosis-Outcomes)
My work for the Kaggle competition titled "Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes," where I developed machine learning models to predict various outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Machine Learning (pycaret, LogisticRegression, RandomizedSearchCV, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor)

## Usage
Each project directory contains a Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis and model-building process, along with datasets and additional resources used. You can navigate to each project's specific folder and follow the instructions provided in the individual README files.
