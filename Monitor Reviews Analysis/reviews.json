Kindly arrange to check and replace on priority", "For office applications, this UHD monitor performs well. If value is important to you, you likely won't be disappointed.\n\ntl;dr\n\nWhen the work you do daily requires a full-time commitment to being in front of a screen to do your job, then the characteristics of that screen can have a substantial impact on your productivity, health, etc. Having used a \"standard\" HD monitor for quite some time at work, I was starting to find it to be too constraining and difficult to work on. I felt it was time for an upgrade to a UHD/4k monitor.\n\nAfter some research, I settled upon this model, as it scored well on use in an office environment (according to rtings.com), it had consistently high reviews, and it was priced attractively here on Amazon. It also included speakers and a versatile stand, which were nice additional perks that I thought could come in handy. I took the plunge and have not been disappointed.\n\nThis monitor has met or exceeded all of my expectations for office applications. The picture is clear. I have ample ability to control brightness, contrast, etc. And the refresh rate remains at 60Hz as long as the attached device can support it. The stand allows for all the control that I could ask for in positioning the display, but I've since attached it to a desk-mounted monitor arm which I also really like. I should also mention that having 2 input channels has been very convenient, as it has allowed me to use it as a shared display between different computers. In a pinch, I've even used the speakers on a few occasions; they're not very good, but then again I don't expect them to be. Also, I have used it once as a monitor for a video game console, and I was quite pleased with it. Again, the audio was sub-par, but the picture (including refresh rate) was excellent.\n\nFor the value, I've been really pleased with this monitor so far. Since I use it primarily for office applications, I can definitely recommend it for that. And as a general-purpose display, it seems to perform well and should not disappoint much. But if you want something that will perform optimally for gaming (especially with high refresh rates), then you will probably not be considering this to begin with. Also, if you want something that has great built-in speakers, I recommend using a TV instead.", "Great monitor, sharp picture and plenty of height, tilt and rotation options.\n\nAlso $50 cheaper than the Dell website plus delivered in 2 days rather than 3-4 weeks quotes by Dell.", "This monitor has been one of the best buys i've made in the last several years. The box arrived in perfect condition, and it is perfect, not a single faulty pixel. I had been using a 24\"1920x1200 Dell Ultrasharp monitor I bought in 2012, it had zero issues and was 100 reliable for over 11 years. The Ultrasharp served me well, but it was time for a 4k monitor. This monitor is an incredible value, it went on sale for two fifty, at that price I couldn't pass it up. It does not cause me any eye strain, the picture is very sharp and clear, 27\" 4k is a huge upgrade form a 1080p display. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the blacks / contrast ratio is very good. I used the rtings icc calibration profile they have for this monitor and it improved the accuracy very noticeably, color accuracy is spot on now. For most users, it will be a great choice, if you are a gamer wanting high refresh rate, or you want a monitor that is meant for HDR content, you might want to look at a bit higher end. For me, I use it with my main PC and mostly for browsing and media consumption, reading & working. I spend many long hours daily staring at a monitor, so it's important that it has no PWM backlighting / is flicker free. This monitor does not cause me any eyestrain. It's been great for casual gaming, movies, editing, etc.. can't beat it for the price imo! It might not be the latest and greatest, but I think this is the best value 4k monitor available atm.

HP, Intel, Microsoft & a few other monitor manufacturers have tried to diagnose what could be causing a Signal Loss. I think I accidentally determined what is likely the cause... My laptops power supply/charger. All monitors I have tested are experiencing a Signal Loss unless I unplug the power supply/charger. This may not be the cause of the issue but it certainly appears to be associated with the issue. It is still unknown how/why this is occurring.\n\nAdditionally, even when leaving the power supply/charger plugged in and using a TV as an external monitor the TV does not experience a Signal Loss like external PC monitors are. A final conclusion has not been reached at this time but I will provide an update if the cause of the issue has been determined.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nHad some good Pros but they were overran by the Cons and regardless of your own views on the Pros & Cons the item was also defective.\n\nMain Issue:\n\nIntermittent Signal Loss - About every 5 to 30 seconds the screen would appear as though the HDMI cord had been unplugged. This issue has been reported by many in these reviews and elsewhere on the internet (PS - I used a Windows device not Apple/Mac). As soon as I setup the monitor the issue occurred and Dell Support had no explanation but offered to send an exchange. I might have considered taking that offer IF I had purchased it from Dell directly but seeing as how I purchased it from Amazon I simply processed a refund a couple hours after receiving this product.\n\nPros:\n\n- An entry price for a 27\" 4k monitor (Awesome price considering the other Pros)\n- Audio Output\n- Built in speakers\n- Could rise/lower\n- Could tilt forwards/backwards\n- Could swivel\n\nCons:\n\n- Intermittent Signal Loss!!!\n- A black screen only appeared as a black cross directly in front of your eyes, it sort of looked somewhat similar to something like the rest of the screen had clouding (must see video to understand as well as see a signal loss)\n- Built in power supply (Makes Monitor bigger, heated & heavier)\n- Faded colors contrast\n- Menu options appear outdated and while downloading the Dell Monitor App was better it was still outdated", "The monitor is very clear (I program all day and need very clear text). I'm running on Windows and scaling at 125%, which helps with font sizes of menus, etc, but still leaves lots of real estate for multiple windows.\n\nI've tried several scaling values, all the way up to 200%, and with each one clarity did not decrease. Impressive.\n\nColors are vivid and seem pretty accurate. Brightness and contrast are good too. Menu options are decent.\n\nThings I'm not a big fan of: monitor vertical travel is very slight. I'm a short guy and even at max height, I'm going to need to prop up the monitor. So \"fail\" on the monitor stand for that.\n\nMay as well not have installed speakers; they are so anemic as to be useless. I just disabled them in the menu.\n\nAlso, there is a slight shadow affect near the right edge and right lower corner. It's not super pronounced and if you look at it head on, you can't see it. But from my peripheral vision while looking at the center of the monitor, my eyes register that that area is a bit darker. For all practical purposes this isn't a problem and I'm not going to return the monitor because of it. My guess is that after a couple of days of using it, it won't register at all. Also, if you happen to have a darker wallpaper, you will probably never notice this.\n\nI was hesitant about whether 4k was overkill for a 27\" monitor, and I would now say \"no\". Just a bit of help from Windows scaling and everything is big enough to easily see and still crystal clear. I switched to this monitor from a QHD monitor from Dell that was also clear, but this one beats the clarity by a noticeable amount.\n\nI'm finding that the HDMI ports can be fussy. I've purchased several DisplayLink docs, and none of them can communicated with these monitors via HDMI, but they can communicate via DisplayPort. Also, when connected via HDMI to Dell dock, there's a 20s lag for the monitor to \"come to life\", which does not happen with my other Dell monitors. Something flaky about this monitor and HDMI.\n\nIf you are looking to dip your toes into the 4k waters, I'd say this is a respectable place to start!", "Just a heads up for people seeking to use this monitor with an M2 series mac such as a new Mac Mini in my case - I had major issues getting this monitor to work properly over a USB-C (Thunderbolt) to DisplayPort (DP) connection. When connected in this way the monitor would intermittently awake from sleep to inform me that there was \"no signal\", very annoying, and even more than annoying are the severe video glitches - shimmering and ghosting effects that required LCD reconditioning to resolve. I had the same cabling set up from the Mac to a separate LG monitor without either of these issues, so it's for sure something to do with the Dell monitor not liking the DP signal send out from the Mac (and/or, something about the type of cable that Dell specifically does not like). Running a cable from Mac USB-C to Dell HDMI takes care of both issues, but since this Dell monitor very sadly does not support PIP/PBP for 2 HDMI sources, and it is very difficult to run an HDMI source into a DisplayPort connector, this means PIP/PBP is basically no-go on Mac.\n\nAll that being said, this monitor does deliver a great image, particularly with HDR turned on. Just be forewarned that it will be difficult to make full use of the DisplayPort connection unless you want to be fighting off glitches left and right!", "Straight angle view from a distance is great. However, if you\u2019re closer, like even at 2 feet, the difference between left and right eyes could. bothers me depending on what I\u2019m working on. Also with a slight angle, the edges of the screen become blurred, as if there is a thick piece of glass.\nGood 4k monitor for the price, but not for heavy graphics or gaming.", "I am using them for business, not for gaming.\nThey place 4 buttons across the bottom, but all they are used for is changing the display source. There are no other on-monitor adjustments.\nThis isn't really an issue though as color correction is typically done through the PC driver anyway, but not sure why it takes 4 buttons to change the source ...\nI still give them a 5 because they are solid monitors with 4k@60 support as advertised and a good picture.", "The first one that showed up was obviously a used/return and was defective out of the box. Had a horrible flickering and reddish tinge. That's Amazon's fault, not Dell's. The replacement was brand new and worked perfectly.\n\nFor this price point, you only get a 60Hz refresh rate, and that's just the way it is. I do wish it had a faster refresh rate, perhaps 75Hz would be nice, but again, the competition here is also only 60Hz, so really not a complaint. Besides, a GPU powerful enough to do modern games in 4K resolution is expensive - so if you can afford a video card that can do high refresh rate gaming at 4K, you're probably willing to spend 3x as much on a monitor.\n\nI have always liked Dell monitors, this in fact replaces two 1080P Dell monitors. Just like all the other Dell monitors I've bought, this one had no dead or stuck pixels. It offers a high build quality with a fully adjustable stand that can rotate and go up/down - something some competing monitors lack.\n\nMy only gripe is they should include a DisplayPort cable in addition to the HDMI cable. That's why I'm deducting a star. You might think that's harsh, but some of the competing monitors do include a DP cable, so Dell can do it too.", "I've been using the Dell S2721QS for a few months now as part of a dual screen setup for both remote work and gaming, and I have to say I'm impressed. The 4K resolution and ultra-thin bezel make for an immersive and striking display, whether I'm working on graphic design projects or immersing myself in the latest games.\n\nThe color and contrast are also top-notch, with deep blacks and vibrant colors that really make images pop. The viewing angles are also great, so it's easy to share the screen with others in a group setting.\n\nIn terms of value for money, the Dell S2721QS is a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it if you're looking for a high-quality 4K display. It's also worth noting that you'll need an HDMI or DisplayPort cable to connect the monitor to your computer, so be sure to factor that into the cost.\n\nSome additional pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n-4K resolution and ultra-thin bezel make for a stunning display\n-AMD FreeSync technology for smooth gaming\n-VESA certified for easy wall or arm mounting\n-Great color and contrast\n\nCons:\n\n-A bit pricey\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Dell S2721QS for anyone looking for a high-quality 4K display for both work and play. The sleek design and advanced technology make it a top choice for both professionals and gamers alike.", "I had a 23\" Samsung for many years. Then I saw one of these Dells at work and decided to upgrade. The old monitor was fine but this is bigger and more beautiful and brighter and I totally love it. As I get older, my vision isn't as perfect, and this lets me choose between more clear, easily readable type and more space for all my windows. 10/10. The only con is that the sound quality isn't great (no surprise), but I have my own speakers so it doesn't matter.", "Luckily no stuck pixels or anything of that nature. Only reason I rated 4 stars for gaming is the long(er) refresh rate. It's a budget 4k display, I didn't buy it for gaming. I'm running 64bit Win-10 Pro, I would HIGHLY recommend (1) Google \"dell s2721qs color profile\" select result from rtings.com, and download the .icm color profile data. Right click, install profile. Open Color Management, click Add, and select the .icm file. Apply. (2) It shouldn't have been this difficult to register the monitor (or get HDR configured) but to register: go to dell.com and create account. Under name click My Products. Click Add Products and switch radio btn to \"Service Tag.\" click the physical button next to the power btn on the monitor twice to display monitor menu, scroll down to Others and enter the \"Service Tag\" in on the Dell website. It should identify it as an S2721QS and congrats, you're registered. From this site you can also download the Dell Display Manager which provides a few nifty features.\nTO TURN ON HDR YOU HAVE TO ENABLE SMART HDR IN MONITORS MENU PANEL. Then you'll be able to select \"Use HDR\" in the Windows HD Color settings. In the monitor menu, I selected \"Desktop\" but it seems there are profiles for gaming and movies as well.\n\nI didn't see any of this info posted in any other review so I figured I'd help a few people out by posting it. All in all, a happy customer after finally figuring out HDR wasn't enabled in the monitors settings by default!", "I spent a lot of hours researching before deciding to go with 2 of these monitors. The main reason I went with the S2721QS is because of the great price for 4k@60Hz (and even has FreeSync) and also it has very high ratings from RTINGS website. They look great and the screen is fantastic. The monitors are used for work as well as for personal use. For work, the ComfortView mode is very helpful. These monitors look great with videos and games as well. I would say this is probably the most versatile monitor for the cost.\n\nThe main reason I knocked off a star is for good reason. I was having flickering issues when settings these monitors running dual at 4k@60Hz with a new thunderbolt docking station that support dual 4k@60Hz. Well, I quickly noticed the HDMI cable these monitors come with are labeled High speed HDMI cables (yes really) with Ethernet. High speed HDMI cables support 4k@30Hz. I have never bought a product where the HDMI cables did not fully support the specs of the device. It would be like buying a PS5 or a Sonos soundbar and it didn't include the right HDMI cable. It seems so absurd and laughable that they would include an HDMI 1.4 cable in this day and age with a monitor that support 4k@60Hz. It's ridiculous, no way around it. I bought Vesa certified display port cables and they are working great with these monitors. And no more issues with my docking station. For the record, the original HDMI 1.4 cables did seem to work with a single monitor setup at 60Hz but this type of cable is still not supported for this type of monitor. To save yourself from future potential problem, buy at least HDMI 2.0 or DP 1.2 cables.", "Weak", "This monitor was an excellent purchase for me and works with my set up great. I use it as my second monitor for photo editing and sometimes for 4k gaming but it depends on what I'm playing. For the price its excellent especially from a reliable company like Dell who has been making quality monitors for sometime. If I had one grip, its that my primary monitor is also dell, and while the bezels and sizes are nearly the exact same, even though the color settings are identically the final look of the two monitors vastly differ, with this one being a little more dim and toned down, however it is a cheaper monitor. Overall I would still reccomend the image quality holds up", "You get what you pay for, and boy was this monitor worth it. The resolution for photos is the best I've seen. Even the text is clear. It cost a bit more but when you consider how long this monitor may last (years) it was worth it to me. I highly recommend this monitor from Dell.\n\nUpdate: A week or two later. This is without a doubt the best PC monitor ever. Better clarity than my own glasses with great photo resolutions and text. I would buy this monitor again in a second. Well done Dell and Amazon.", "The picture quality is perfect!", "I use for external monitor for Microsoft Teams Meetings and other business functions. Works great, text is very clear. I do not use this monitor for gaming (not it's strength).", "Monitor came with local dimming issue (dark region in the lower 3rd of the screen) and looked like a shadow across the screen. Not giving Dell a second chance. Too many other competitors.", "Great monitor to use for work - easy to read the smaller print", "I've loved this Dell monitor for it's very thin bezel and great picture clarity. I use it as part of a multi-monitor setup where one monitor is in landscape mode and the Dell S2721QS 27 inch is in portrait mode. The thin bezels on both these Dell monitors means the screen gap between the two is negligible and I can operate without even noticing. Excellent.\n\nBUT after 6 months or so the Dell S2721QS 27inch started automatically jumping into it's own settings controls without me initiating the action. My guess is this is because being in portrait mode was not one of the designed-for use cases and the impacts of gravity over time on the switches (little nubby things on the outer frame - see red circled area on third image) were unanticipated.\n\nIn any case, it's very annoying to have this happen constantly. It's like having a notification you didn't sign up for pop onto your screen every 3 to 5 minutes ALL DAY. You can ignore it and it goes away, but it comes back reliably. SUPER ANNOYING.\n\nThe other monitor I have, the one in landscape mode, is also a Dell and it's great. My guess is that if the one I'm having trouble with were not used in portrait mode I would be saying it is great too, so buy it for landscape mode or avoid it.", "Brighter than most 4 k monitors I have seen. It\u2019s crisp on text and colors are very deep. Mounts nicely also very light for a large monitor.

I forgot it was this bad, especially with the low response time. Out of the box, programs like google chrome, creep and crawl.\n\nWith that said, gaming. Using an Xbox series X, I noticed the dreaded ghosting. A good amount that I noticed it. The picture, is actually beautiful though. The screen itself, contrast, etc, views really well. It's just, in movement, it lags in comparison to any monitor with a higher refresh rate. Also, the HDR, its terrible.

Viewing angle is very important to prevent fatigue. He has been using it for a month or so now and he absolutely loves it. He says he can set it up as two separate screen when using his laptop. I actually didn't think the Mac laptops did that. Maybe he's more techy than I. The picture quality is fantastic. It lives up to the beautiful quality of the MacBook. We connect it through the USB-C to Display Port cable (also purchased on Amazon) as I read that gave the best resolution. Very happy with purchase, 10/10. Also, I tried buying it from Dell 2 months before X-mas and Dell emailed me 3 days before the holiday to say that the monitor would arrive in January! WTF DELL! I ordered immediately from Amazon and had it within 36 hours. Pretty much the same price and very similar model. You've got to love Amazon.", "I bought two of these during the Amazon Prime days... I was on the fence as I didn't need new monitors, however they were a steal for the price offered and I was replacing 2x Dell 27\" monitors that were only 1080.\n\nI received them a few days ago and I'm so happy with the purchase. Color is great, brightness/contrast is awesome, and zero pixel issues! Solid monitors and a must-buy!", "I bought the 27\" adjustable stand model of this and so far I love it. The text looks super crisp and it has a vesa mount for when I can get some monitor arms hooked up to it. I didn't have any issues using it with my MBP at all. One caveat I learned, and this is super minor, is that if you want to use the PIP (picture in picture) or PBP (picture by picture) it appears you need one input to be HDMI and the other HAS to be display port. I have my PS4 and MBP hooked up to the two HDMI ports and I can't use this feature. My solution was to buy a USB-C to Display port cable for my MBP output and I have yet to try that out. I can still easily toggle between the two inputs using the two HDMI ports, so that's nice. I was mostly interested in seeing how the PIP or PBP looks.\n\nOther comments have mentioned that the stand doesn't pivot left/right, but that's not true. Mine does on the \"adjustable\" style.\n\nUPDATE: I hooked up a USBC to display port cable from my MacBook and then used the hdmi cable from my ps4 and was able to do picture in picture and side by side. Its cool, but not very practical on a 27\" screen.", "I needed a 4k monitor with built-in speakers. This monitor fits my need at a reasonable price. Great quality, with no dead or always-on pixels in my case. Easy and safe stand assembly. No power adaptor block -- just plug the power cord (which is great). Speaker (3w) quality was a pleasant surprise. It sounds better than the 5w USB speakers I was using. Strongly recommend in general.\n\nThings you may want to double-check: This monitor has no USB hub. The stand is not as great as the other Dell monitors. You can adjust the height. You can tilt a little, but not much. Swivel is almost impossible. This monitor supports rotation, but you need your custom monitor arm. The power cord is a bit short -- you may need an extension depending on your power outlet location.", " TL;DR - this monitor is perfect on paper. 4k, 60 Hz refresh, speakers, 180\u00b0 tilt, adjustable height, super shallow profile. I love it. Or... I WOULD, if it would work.\n\nInstead, this monitor disconnects, says \"scanning for signal\", and reconnects several times a day, at random. It sounds minor until it happens for the 5th time during a meeting, presentation, or when it pushes 6 working windows back to your laptop.\nThis happens with all THREE of my DELL laptops, btw.\n\nIt. Drives. Me. Nuts.\nAbsolutely nuts.\n\nI've tried everything to remedy this. New power cable, new HDMI cable, new USB hub. My boyfriend does this for a living and couldn't fix it. I even got tech support to send me a replacement. They ALL have this issue, so I'm fairly sure it's due to incompatibility with the laptops / Windows OS.\n\nMy advice would be to buy it from a place with a liberal return policy. Use it heavily during the return window and SHIP IT BACK ASAP if it glitches. There is NO remedying this issue once it happens.\n\nI'm extremely bummed. This was a \"premium\" upgrade that's now sitting on the floor of my office while my emails to Dell go unanswered.", "Actually it is the best budget 4K monitor with slim case, amazing picture quality, 60 Hz refresh rate with 4K and adjustable structure.

It needs to just work without having to fiddle with everything.", "My 1K 24\" monitors crapped out after 10 years. Had them side by side for heavy duty desktop / coding use. These 27\" 4K monitors are a huge improvement. Controls are along the bottom so work well in side by side and with my existing dual mount arm with VESA 100mm attachments. Only complaint is I had to angle them more to get more of the screen the same distance away. Also, for my older eyes, I had to set the scaling to 175%. Which drops it to a QHD effective resolution. One power and one HDMI cable in the box. Really great quality for the price. Refresh rate seems low for gaming use.\n(I did end up returning them to get the almost identical monitors that are truly curved screen and only QHD resolution. So those are 100% scaling to meet the same screen size / readability as these. But slightly nicer with less angling to get the screen readable across the whole length of two side by side.)", "The Bad\nReally well made budget 4K display, with a few detractors. Firstly I did get a panel with a stuck red pixel; which has never gone away despite a few trying recommended techniques to get rid of it. It is only noticeable in really dark images, its just a speck with such fine pixels. It wasn't worth the risks that come with return/exchange of getting something worse.\n\nThere is some issue with ghosting and traces with darker images in gaming, but not bad for a general use monitor. I did encounter some image retention with bright, fullscreen patterns persisting for 30 minutes; but was resolved with the built-in tool after about 10 minutes.\nThat points to a manufacturing quality flaw; impurities in the liquid crystals: Display Uniformity issues leading to Parasitic Capacitance or a Charge Buildup. A Screensaver that have random patterns and colors can help dissipate that excess charge.\n\nBuilt-in speaker(s) sound pretty weak; just awful really. Sounds like a phone speaker in a plastic box.\n\nThe Good:\nLatency is very good compared to other monitors I've owned. Color can be very accurate with a little bit of tuning. The antiglare coating or treatment works well without being noticeable. The display is generally bright enough to use in a well-lit room. Upscales 1080p content fairly well. HDR and FreeSync is just okay on this monitor; but is what I expected for the price.\n\nThe stand is really adjustable, and is surprisingly stable/balanced. The plastic seems pretty high quality, with the exception of the front bezel.\n\nGot it on sale for a bargain price. Less than some 2k or even 1080p displays this size (27\")\n\nUPDATE: After less than two years; I have horizontal .2 mm gray lines covering 2/3 of the monitor from the right side spaced about 3mm apart. Inverse ghosting and image retention lasts longer and appears more easily. Running lcd conditioning fixes the temporary image retention, but those gray lines are permanent. Stuck red pixel never did go away. Defective LCD.\nI've ruled out my graphics card and hdmi cable as the source of trouble; since I tested that with my old monitor and didn't see any artifacts. New replacement 4k monitor (LG) has no issues running on existing hardware.\n\n20 months to partial failure for a monitor of any price is unacceptable. It's not a generic display, it's Dell. I give it as many stars as its years of service- 2.", "Pefect hi-resolution monitor to see all that's depicted if tired of straining to see/read an older PC monitor or media screen.\nIt's perfect!", "Use it eveery day it works like it was supposed to", "Not bright enough.

The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 was the stand and monitor connector which even at a low height setting wobbles. Even when typing vigorously you can clearly see the monitor bobbling away, which could be fixed with some attention to detail. Great buy!", "Update:\n\nAfter just a few months, every-other row of pixels is now dimmer than the rest (on both monitors). From a distance you don\u2019t really notice, but as a graphic artist, it is extremely frustrating. The dimmer rows are only about 4% dimmer than the others, but it results in a low-resolution/interlaced look and doesn\u2019t accurately reflect what I\u2019m creating.\n\nI sent many photos and tests to Dell, but they simply assured me the monitors are fine.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI bought one of these and then came back for another. At first, the black levels were very disappointing, but somehow, when I used a Display Port cable instead of HDMI, I was able to get really beautiful rich blacks. The default brightness is lackluster as well, but if you turn it up to 100%, it looks great. HDR support is wonky and didn't produce good results in any setting. When I was able to make it work, all it really did was make everything which was not intended to be super bright, dim and washed out.\n\nThis is my first experience with HDR. From what I have seen so far, it seems like a bad gimmick. The industry should just make bright monitors with good black levels and let the artists balance their content as intended.\n\nWith the display port cables and with the brightness turned all the way up (and with HDR off) this is a great 4k monitor at a good price.", "This monitor is fantastic for work. I bought it to reduce neck strain while working on my laptop. Picture quality and brightness are fantastic, but I had one huge issue with the monitor. Everything was lagging, and I mean even just typing was slow. I have an Acer Nitro 5 with a Nvidia GTX1650 graphics card. I managed to fix the problem by buying a really high speed HDMI cable. The one that comes in the box is NOT good enough. Also, some older computers will have a HDMi 1.4 connection, which can only produce 4k at 30hz, and you will have lag no matter what. Check that you have HDMI 2.0 output before you buy this or any other 4k monitor.", "The box came in open on one side but the monitor works. The display port cable does not match my laptop connection and I need to buy display to mini display cable in order to get 4K. Cable came. I am able to get 3840x2160 resolution. The monitor is sharp. Great looking, too. Wish they can come with 2 display ports as I'd like to connect two computers to this monitor (not using two computers at the same time, of course). The HDMI ports do not get 4K resolution.", "For all you wondering if it's compatible with a Macbook Pro, it did NOT fully operate properly on the Dell monitor. Intermittently worked in 3-5 second intervals then went all black and kept showing 'Scanning for Signal' or 'No HDMI signal from your device'.

Other reviewers mentioned this defect which has helped me to remedy the problem. I have a Surface Laptop connected to a Microsoft Dock and two monitors. The HDMI cable that Dell provides in the box would not support 4K resolution. I tried several other HDMI cables and the best resolution I could get was 1920 x 1080, which is much below 4K standards. Finally, I purchased a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable, connected it to the Dock and Dell monitor and immediately got 3840 x 2160 resolution. For that reason I gave 4 stars for a very good monitor.", "My computer is a 2015 MacBook Pro to which I want an external monitor. I tried another brand and although displayed videos and pictures were clear, the web and e-mail text was awful. I tried this Dell monitor. Although I wasn't expecting to pay this much for my monitor, this is truly a spectacular monitor for my use.\n\nVideos and pictures are crystal clear. I am not a videographer nor photographer so I cannot attest to color trueness. For me and my use, I find this monitor exceptional!\n\nThe only issue I have is I cannot control the brightness from my bluetooth keyboard. The previous monitor was controllable from the keyboard. Instead, I must use the awkwardly placed (under the front right of the screen) monitor controls to find the brightness menu and adjust. Other than that, I highly recommend this monitor.", "macOS users, take note of the following:\n\nThis monitor will force you into YPbPr when connected via HDMI. To get the device to correctly recognize RGB you will need to connect via Display Port. When connected via DisplayPort, you will be unable to scale your display without the display flickering. The default scale for the 27\" monitor is 1920x1080. This monitor does not have macOS support via the Dell Display Manager software.\n\nIt's possible a ~$45 USB-C to DisplayPort adapter may resolve that issue but I haven't taken the plunge yet.\n\n-----\n\nOverall review: This is a decent true 4K monitor for the price, until you realize the basic items that are missing. This monitor does not have any additional connection ports. No USB-C, no USB-A/B. Nothing. You get 2 HDMI ports and 1 Display Port and an audio jack and that's it.\n\nThe adjustment is nice and I appreciate how easy it is to find a height and angle that works for my needs... but the monitor itself feels quite flimsy on its stand and easily wobbles from side-to-side when touched. This makes the product feel far cheaper in quality than it otherwise might.", "Very nice monitor.", "I bought two of them for home office use. The added size and resolution provides so much more working space, while also having very sharp text. Has great video quality and will work with mild gaming. Not a high end gaming monitor as motion blur is noticeable. I highly recommend", "This may not be considered a gaming monitor but it definitely does the job. Upgraded to the Xbox Series X and wanted a 4K monitor to get the most out of the games. The 60 Hz didn't bother me because most games will likely not support the 120 Hz and the prices of a 120 Hz 4K monitor were out of my budget. The HDR looks good and the screen is definitely bright. The multitude of ports on the back make it possible for me to connect both my PC via DisplayPort and Xbox via HDMI and quickly switch between them with the nice interface on the monitor. Having built-in speakers is also a nice touch for the Xbox audio, they're nothing fantastic, but they'll get the job done.\n\nOverall, this is a great monitor for the price and definitely does the job if you're looking to game on it. If you're looking at playing more competitive games, perhaps look for a lower resolution monitor with a higher refresh rate, but if you're looking for a quality picture, this monitor is the one.", "This seems like a good monitor, doing 4k60. I had to return it, though, because as soon as I plugged it in, I started getting digital/electrical noise in my Yamaha reference speakers. I tried running the monitor on a separate power jack but no luck. I also tested moving the speaker away from the monitor but the sound didn\u2019t change or diminish.\n\nI think it\u2019s a power issue\u2026. This monitor has a built in power supply whereas the one before it (a Samsung) and the one I replaced it with (an LG) have an external power supply and don\u2019t create any noise at all.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth I\u2019m connecting to a 2018 MacBook Pro so maybe Dell and Apple don\u2019t play nice or something.\n\nThis is kind of a niche problem but if you have sensitive speakers, you might watch out for it.", "Brand new monitor, so no long term review. But out of the box, I couldn't get 4K resolution, wasn't even an available pick in Windows settings or my Nvidia control panel.\nProblem? I was using an older HDMI cable (with mini-DP adapter at the video card), and the system knew it, so wouldn't even allow the higher resolution picks.\nSolution: I installed a pure Displayport cable. System recognized it and now allows me to pick the highest resolution - 3840x2160. Yay. The cable makes a difference.\n\nOnly other problem: I have 2 monitors, the other is a regular HD monitor. I'm always moving windows from one monitor to the other, and that screws up the sizing and scaling of the windows. Guess I'll just have to buy another 4K monitor!", "This 4K Dell monitor has great quality with minimal to zero black light bleed, in fact it is hard to notice anything at any of the corners. It also has higher contrast (1300:1) than comparable displays at the same price range. For the money I think it is a pretty good deal.\n\nFor the context I used to have different Dell monitors from 24\" full HD (S2340M) all the way up to 27\" WQHD (U2719DC). Although I miss the USB type C port from this specific model, it was just worth an extra $200-$300 (at least for me) to get a monitor equipped with one. It has one Displayport and two HDMIs, so you can hook up 3 different devices and switch between them as long as they support 4K at 60hz.\n\nI am planning to use this display and possibly an additional one of the same type (as it supports VESA mount) mainly for work (i.e. programming).

The resolution and colors are outstanding. The 27\" screen size took a little time to adjust to as far as scale, as I was coming from a 22\" 1080 LG. While Windows recommends the display scale to be at 150%, I found that the text was a little too small for me to read, so I have it set at 175%, but I definitely welcome the extra space. A 27\" monitor has about 38% more screen area than a 22\".\n\nIf you're moving up in resolution or size, this monitor will give you a whole new perspective. I'm very happy stepping into the 27\" 4k world with this Dell.", "I find dell to be a reliable brand so I chose this monitor to get my first taste of 4k.

But, it's super-easy to put together and take apart to pack up for traveling. A perfect traveling monitor for my needs.\n\nI am using this primarily for editing and book layout - lots of work in Photoshop, InDesign, Word, Excel.

When I go to the Dell website and try to have it recognize the monitor it comes up with a dialogue that states only PCs are supported. Anyone know of how to get around this, let me know?

We decided to try it out anyway before going to the trouble of returning it. We LOVE it, in spite of it being a flat screen. I feel that you should change the image that is used for selling this monitor so that it does not show a curved screen.

As I was new to buying 4K monitors, I did my best to carefully research the various least expensive options, particularly in relation to Mac systems with the new M1 chip. The one I initially looked at (a little cheaper than this one, but not much) had mentioned a substantial lag (~30+ seconds) when waking the Mac from sleep. But I found good reviews on this one from M1 MacBook owners. I also noticed LG is the only 3rd party monitor brand sold on Apple\u2019s website; so that was added confidence.\n\nIt includes both an HDMI cable (HDMI to HDMI) and a DisplayPort cable (DP to DP), both of which still need an adapter of some sort to plug into one of the iMac\u2018s Thunderbolt ports. I already had ordered and received a dock/hub with USB-A ports and an HDMI port before I ordered this monitor, so I started with that.\n\nUnder HDMI (the adapter I was using was rated for 4K/30Hz), I did notice about a 5 second lag when waking my iMac display for the LG to wake as well. It also took some troubleshooting to get it to display at 4K instead of 1080p, but once I got it into 4K, it stayed there.\n\nI eventually purchased a DisplayPort to Thunderbolt cable (rated 4K/60Hz) and with that cable, the lag for waking from sleep is now about 2 seconds, which is very decent I think. As the iMac only allows one additional monitor (with the exception of using an iPad for desktop extension), I think I had to reboot the iMac for it to recognise it through the DisplayPort instead.\n\nOverall very good value for the price.", "Tres belle \u00e9cran!

Granted this might be a Windows 10 issue but that goes to my next part that the included software wouldn't install properly. I had to manually add the monitor driver via device manager. I shouldn't have to do that. The software shouldn't require me to do that as it is required to get the monitor to work.\n\nHaving said all that the monitor is simple stunning and I will never go back. Sharp, clear and nice.

But if you are looking for multi monitor setup or doing graphic / video work, then you need to be aware! I bought 2 of 27UL500 from amazon to replace my old dual 1080p setup. These two monitors not only came with slight but noticeable difference in color. One of them has a 'Manual' color temperature option which allows you to adjust color temp from 5k to 10k in 500 increment, this manual adjust is totally missing on the 2nd monitor with only 3 factory presets (Warm Medium Cool). If you are using these monitors side by side, you can never get the them to the same color. You may ask why not set both to one of the preset? I tried. They naturally came with about 500-1k difference. The stickers on the back of the monitors say they were both made in 2019.10. It's really odd LG installed different firmware with important function missing in the same production batch. Don't waste your time with LG support. It is a firmware issue. Unless you are handy enough and willing to void the warranty by breaking the shell open and flashing the ROM with a programmer yourself, there is nothing you can do, other than, of course, return.", "This is my 2nd purchase of this model, i knew that this is a great monitor.

So if you lose it or break it that means no fast/easy replacement; order it on the internet and cross your fingers that it still exist somewhere.

It would seem trite that an awesome 4k UHD display such as this would naturally lend itself well to viewing one of the current very limited legitimate sources for 4k. But after due research, including deliberately sending an email to AOC support, I have duly verified it can't do that. Region-coding, among other things, have been removed from 4k ultraHD blu-ray discs. Against that, however, some other security restrictions have been imposed, with a view most likely to prevent people from pirating that exposed precious 4k content. One is the protected audio-video path (PAVP) and the other, explicitly, is HDCP 2.2. The absence of the latter with this monitor is why it can't do 4k ultraHD BDs. Relatedly, the absence of an accepted form of PAVP is why even the latest external nVidia and AMD graphics card models can't display the same, attempting to play such a disc from a capable drive such as https://www.amazon.ca/LG-Electronics-Blu-ray-Writer-Optical/dp/B079LR2Q67/ref=sr_1_2?\nDisappointingly, the only way to currently play 4k ultraHD blu-ray discs on the computer (with, say, PowerDVD) is through the built-in Intel HD graphics after enabling the SGX feature in BIOS (if it's present & supported & can be toggled on & off), and an HDCP 2.2 compliant monitor; sadly, this monitor IS NOT one of them.\nI thought that perhaps ALL 4k computer monitors would have been HDCP 2.2 compliant by default. It appears not. Why waste those gorgeous pixels anyway? Now I understand why, if it's compliant, this feature is explicitly stated in a monitor specs.

Por mucho la enciendo una a dos veces por semana una hora m\u00e1ximo.", "No tiene audio, pero por su precio, est\u00e1 ok", "I had gone through several monitors for my flight sim/work/occasional photo editing setup, I started with an old 24\" 1080p IPS panel but trying to fly with only one monitor is no fun, it was ok for everything else. I scavenged 3 22\" 1080p TN panels that were ok for flying but no good for work or photo editing. I then purchased 3 24\" 1080 VA 144hz panels, the high refresh was nice but the color was worse than the TN panels. I returned those and purchased 3 of the 27\" 4k IPS AOC panels. Here's the pros and cons\nPros:\n-Excellent color compared to everything I've used previously\n-Amazing clarity on text and photos\n-No noticeable backlight bleed\n-Outstanding viewing angles\n-Minimal bezel looks great in multi monitor setup\n-Color calibration and uniformity certificate with each monitor, and the certified measurements are absolutely incredible at this price point, color average deltaE is 0.4 to 0.5 for the monitors I received and uniformity is almost perfect 100%, one of the monitors has 99% at one of the measurement locations, I know where it from the certificate but I cannot see any deviation in brightness with my eyes\n-3 inputs allows me to run my PC, Mac and laptop dock without an expensive triple monitor 4k kvm (I have a basic usb switch to take care of switching the keyboard and mouse)\n-Scales lower resolutions really well, 1080 and 1440 have minimal blurring\n\nCons:\n-One of the HDMI inputs is only 1.4 which maxes out at 4k 30hz\n-HDMI inputs are not labeled which is HDMI 2.0 and which is HDMI 1.4, also no mention of which is which in the manual (as of now I don't know which is which as my Mac and laptop dock max out at 4k 30, my work ordered a Dell D6000 dock which will do 2 monitors at 4k 60 and the third at 4k 30. I'll try to update this when I figure it out which port is which) - EDIT- HDMI 1 is 4k 60, HDMI 2 is 4k 30\n-The area around the inputs looks \"cheap\" the black plastic cover has some big gaps around the input area so you can see the metal inside and silver tape\n-Some ghosting or trailing due to slow pixel response times, really only noticeable when you move a white mouse pointer on a very dark background\n\nNit picks:\n-Only 60hz, but you're not going to find a high refresh 4k anywhere near this price point, you're looking at almost 10x the price for 144hz, at least for now\n-Not Freesync or variable refresh, same as above\n\nNotes:\n-The panel is 10bit/pixel but I don't think it accepts a 30bit color input, all of my computers indicate 24bit color with no option for 30bit. 24bit is good enough for me so I have not investigated it any further\n\nI am extremely satisfied with these monitors, great value for such an amazing display.

What an upgrade! The picture is very bright, crisp, and clear and I'm very pleased with them especially at the Black Friday price that I paid.\nI'm giving it 5 stars but a few cautions: This is a 2019 model but there haven't been any vast improvements to the technology since then, so not really an issue. The plastic bezel around the top and sides is indeed very thin, like 1/16\" or 1mm but the screen itself has about a 1/4\" or 5mm black area around the display so you won't get a 'seamless' appearance when you set them side-by-side. They do not have speakers, although they do have a headphone jack which extracts the audio from the HDMI. And finally, I cannot attest to its gaming abilities as I am not a gamer. But for a content creator, these are great!", "I replaced a standard HD 24\" monitor. Gosh, this is sooooooo much better! Clear and sharp, and it shows so much more data at the higher screen resolution. What a great deal.", "Okay, so I bought this a while back as a second monitor. I do photography and videography, but only need to deliver in sRGB for the internet, so the 100% sRGB appealed to me (I managed to get to 99.8% of the sRGB gamut with DisplayCal). Surprisingly, though, I learned that I was getting nearly 89% of the AdobeRGB and 91% of the DCI-P3 gamuts when calibrated and verified. These are very good numbers, ones that even an LG 27UN850-W monitor costing almost twice as much doesn't even come close to.\n\nThis is a good choice as a monitor for office work, imaging and viewing films. What I most like about this monitor is the unobtrusive anti-reflective coating, the lack of blooming of white on black text and the very reliable color accuracy. I don't game with it because I'm a responsible adult with a wide range of other time-sucking hobbies, but I'm sure with the meager refresh rate, it's not going to satisfy any hardcore gamers. But what I need it for, for doing some (non-critical) color-correct viewing, it meets and surpasses my expectations. The only downside for that is some inconsistency in the brightness uniformity. But this is absolutely forgivable for my purposes and I hardly even notice it.\n\nHowever, the brightness uniformity issue some have written about here leads to my next point about build quality. Here there are some issues. I suspect the uniformity issue is an issue of inconsistent quality control, because mine is tolerable and not as bad as some of the other examples seen here. Also, quality control was no doubt at issue when my monitor started developing vertical black lines after one year. This is caused by the adhesive degrading and the electrical inputs that connect to the display losing contact. I called AOC about it, I was asked to provide a few pictures and then I sent the monitor back. Thankfully, there's a generously long three-year warranty period on it. Because of the price I paid for it, I wasn't about to complain about losing it for three weeks, having to pay my own shipping and providing my own box, which they didn't send back to me. I was just happy to get a completely new one in an acceptable time-frame.\n\nLooking at the monitor and comparing it to other displays, such as my partner's MacBook Pro with the Retina display or the aforementioned piece of junk from LG, made me realize what a great buy this is. AOC is sacrificing a bit with build quality to provide some high capabilities in terms of what you buy the monitor for anyways: viewing. And with how fast display technology is moving, who really cares if the thing fails on you after three years?\n\ntl;dr buy this thing for literally anything else than gaming", "Fantastic bargain when on sale for $240.\n\nFor $508 and some change, including tax, I purchased a pair of these.\nThey replaced a pair of 24-inch Dell U2412M displays at 1920x1200,\nand cost less than those displays. This goes to show how pricing of technology\ncontinues to drop.\n\nWhat's not to like:\n\nGlossy frame.\nThere's no mention of this just about anywhere.\nI'm not a fan of this at all, while others doon't seem to care either way, so it's a tradeoff.\nIn my own use setup, I've not been bothered by reflections, but consider this\nif you may get distracting reflections in your own use.\n\nAll of that damned 'protective' tape covering the glossy surfaces.\nIt's not a lot, and it only covers the front bezel and perimeter,\nbut it was ridiculously difficult for me to find a starting place\nto get that unnecessary crap off the monitors. Plus, it's secured\nto itself in places by cellophane tape.\n\nI can't speak of the base/stand, because they're on a steel VESA dual-mount clamped\nsecurely to my desk.\n\nAn odd button/joystick for power and all other controls, but it's surprisingly simple to use.\n\nNot as \"bezel-less\" as the pictures would suggest: there's about a 1mm frame around the front glass,\nbut the active display is about 1/4-inch from the outer rim on top and sides.\nEven so, it's an improvement on the half-inch bezel of my previous Dell monitors,\neffectively reducing the separation between them by half.\n\nSuper-bright as received, just as expected.\n\nWhat's to like:\n\n4K display, costing less than most highly-acclaimed monitors from a few years ago.\n\nRich colors and contrast, with a much higher Dynamic Range than what they replaced.\nI don't have to turn the brightness up as high as I used to for very dark games.\nColors seem nicely saturated, while not overcooked.\nBrightness reduced from factory 70% to 45% took care of the expected overbright.\n\n27-inch displays replaced my 24-inch displays at lower cost, giving me more display area.\n\nNo dead or stuck pixels found in full white, black and grey.\n\nThere are some issues with scaling on a 4K output with some programs, but most\nreasonably modern programs can be taught to behave, such as Photoshop CS6.\n\nColor calibration would seem to be real, as both monitors were packed with result printouts\nof the calibration. I made a change of 100K temperature to one, instead of the few-thousand K\nof the old ones, and these are far more equal than the old.\n\nPackaging is robust. It's packed in formed Styrofoam forms, and mine arrived in sturdy boxes\nwith no apparent abuse, even though Amazon left them on my doorstep without concealment\nof the products. And yes, it was Amazon delivery, not USPS or FedEx or UPS, and as usual,\nthey just dropped and scanned without a knock on the door.\n\nOverall: You can't do better than this monitor if you can get it for $240 or less.", "I bought this at the end of 2019 as a gift for myself. I wanted a monitor that would be good for gaming and illustrations. Here's a run down of my specific wants:\n\n> 27\" monitor (I felt 32\" was too large. I would be fine with a 24\", but this was, again, a gift for myself and I quite liked this size in comparison)\n> LED + IPS monitor\n> 4K Ultra HD resolution\n> High brightness\n> High color gamut\n> Low response time\n> High refresh rate\n> Anti-glare/Matte\n> VESA mountable\n\nIf you've looked into this monitor some more, you will notice that it does not satisfy everything I wanted. The U2790VQ is NOT a LED monitor, but an LCD with WLED backlight, which is better than an LCD monitor without an LED backlight. It also does not have a high refresh rate; it caps at 60 fps (tested and true). But when put side by side to other 27\" monitors with similar specs at this price, the U2790VQ was still the best option.\n\nThis monitor has the highest brightness of 350 cd/m^2 compared to similar ones at this price point. There were others that had a higher refresh rate, but lower brightness and color gamut. Since I planned to use my computer for illustrations, the refresh rate wasn't as important of a factor as the brightness and color gamut. There were more expensive ones that could satisfy EVERYTHING I wanted, but I would be looking at, at minimum, a $150 increase in price, which I wasn't willing to shell out for. So, that is to say, I was willing to exchange these two points for the savings.\n--------------------------\nI am back after a year just to see if the market has anything that might fit my wants better at the $200-$300 price point, but it seems that it is still the best option. I practically use it everyday for long periods of time, especially since COVID began, and it has not failed me in any regard. There is no bleeding, no dead cells, nothing. It's as good as it was right out of the box. I don't have to use it at full brightness--especially in the room I have it in--but it is nice to have that option. The screen is not AS consistent in color at different angles as I would like, but it is minimal and is only a slight nuisance when doing my illustrations. It is far better than a normal LCD monitor. Sometimes I do wish for higher fps, but I'm used to playing at lower fps rates anyhow, so it isn't something that bothers me--just a thing I would be looking for when I eventually upgrade to a monitor worth more than $500. I will be sticking with this one until then.", "My AOC 27\" 4K monitors are great. Color quality and brightness are meet my needs for general computer use (I do not do much graphics, video, or picture editing and no gaming). In fact, I've not made any adjustments to the picture settings. I do a lot of work in Excel and Word and the detail provided by 4K is amazing. Gridlines and numbers in Excel and fonts in Word are amazingly fine and crisp. It really improves using both apps. I'm also a high school volleyball coach and watch a lot of game videos which likewise are greatly improved in 4K (I use a GoPro 7 Black for filming). I bought the monitors to replace two 24\" Dell monitors from work when I retired in January. I run them off a new Dell XPS 13\" through a CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 dock with one running off the HDMI port and one off the Display Port. I do not use the included stands, other than for setting up the initial connection to the dock, but the stands were very easy to connect and disconnect to the monitors and I kept them in case I ever change my configuration. I do recall that the monitor position on the stands was rather low, maybe only 6\" above the desk surface. Each of my monitors is mounted on a separate Huanuo articulated monitor arm attached to the back of my desk. I knew the 27\" monitors were not going to fit inside the side supports of the hutch of my desk which is only 46.5\" wide on the inside, so I have them positioned in front of the hutch with the center of the screens approximately at eye level. With the Huanuo arms, it's easy to move them down or to the side when needed to access the hutch or to bring one forward for close work. My only disappointment is that the side bezels are .3\", not quite as thin as I was expecting from the \"Frameless\" heading and looking at the pictures online. In my arrangement there's about .62\" space between active screen segments when perfectly aligned next to each other. Currently, I never have windows that span both screens, but I do plan to use this setup for Microsoft Flight Simulator someday and I had hoped for a slightly more seamless main display. If you're not familiar with AOC, the company is a direct descendent of the old Admiral TV and appliance company. When I was growing up in the 60s, many people had Admiral color TVs when color was first appearing. When I realized this I was more confident in giving these monitors a try and I've been completely satisfied with them.", "Easy to install and excellent quality", "First, the good: The actual LED panel looks great. For a daily desktop screen, this is a solid 4k setup and in a great size and thin-bezel form factor. It's a very clean mechanical design and the LED indicator isn't trying to overpower the brightness of the screen.\n\nBut: I have this plugged into a Lenovo X1 Carbon laptop. The laptop has worked great with Acer, ViewSonic, and even Dell monitors. Two of those are also 4k screens that use Display Port from the laptop. Even running dual monitors through a USB-C dock has been very reliable. This monitor, however, has a lot of trouble with this laptop. At random times during regular use of the computer, the whole screen just blanks out to black and comes back to life as if it's coming out sleep mode or the laptop is waking up. Sometimes it will happen several times within a few minutes. Other times it seems to go most of the day and only cut out once or twice. There's no pattern I can figure out.\n\nI imagine, if it works with your computer without any hiccups, it'll be a solid monitor for regular desktop use.", "This is a review for the U2790VQ. These are selling like hotcakes during covid since everyone is working from home but if you wait patiently you will get one. This is probably not the best gaming monitor since it's slow but for office productivity, light coding, it fits the bill. I've tried philips and LG but this one seems to fit the bill the best for the budget. I am using this with a macbook pro 2015 so the native resolution is 2560 x 1440 (QHD). The Default for this is 1920 x 1080 but if you want more real estate i would go larger. Though it can do 4k, I usually upscale so that the font and text is clearer. The OSD is kind of rudimentary, nothing as good as LGs or Philips but it works. There's even some blue light filter modes that make it yellowish to save your eyes. The panel is made by Panda LM270PF1L which is found in the philips as well. It's matte and 3H hardness so its pretty good glarewise. I have just powered it on for a bout a day but I will review in a months time for daily use. I may get a second to get more realestate and a dual monitor mount. display is pretty light, about 3kgs without the stand. The stand? Pretty crappy. I would say just throw it out. It's all plastic and it wobbles on my sturdy desk. I understand why manuf. want to cut costs and they do it with the stand. It's not even height adjustable. It tilts about 15' only. Brightness is pretty good. No sound even though speaker grills are there. I think they use this shell for another model. It doesn't matter anyway since most monitor speakers are pretty weak at 3W or even 5W. Just hook it up to something else since there's a headphone jack.\n\nBezel is pretty thin, I would say 5mm on all side, the bottom is the thickest. Maybe next time they can just make the AOC symbol light gray instead of silver. Back has 2 HDMI, 1 DP which is my suggested way to connect since it offers the best resolutions.\n\nIf you can pick it up below $250s. It's still worth it. I wish they had this exact one in 32\" but I guess that's for the future. End of line.", "I purchased this monitor on the 8th of December as an early Christmas present for myself. as of 4/1/2023 the screen has had this green line on it. I did not buy the warranty through amazon as the manufacturer has a warranty for new purchases when you register the product online.\n\nI registered the product through the account I made just for this monitor only for them to tell me I am after my \"90 day\" period for returns, but the real kicker is they can fix the monitor!!!\n\nIf I pay shipping.\n\nI've had the monitor a total of 118 days before it crapped out right in front of me as I was watching youtube.\n\nThe overall quality of the monitor was great, the pixel density is nice, but the screen is very prone to tearing and issues without V-sync. This purchase gave me such buyers remorse I will not be purchasing from this company (AOC) for any other monitors or electronics. I'll update this as I get info from AOC regarding the repair of my monitor.\n\nUPDATE: the repair is not guaranteed to work due to travel and could possibly damage from there back to the house so I guess no more AOC products for me, way too much of a hassle imo.", "i like the way it looks and the way it works, keep this in mind, this is my very first pc and I don't game on it but what i do do is video editing and let me just say if it can handle all I'm throwing it now seamlessly its going to be a beast when i really get elbow deep in it", "M1 MacBook Pro 14 inch/ Flat Screen\n\nI purchased this for an office use, mainly for document-editing, pdf-reading, and research work for ph.d studies. 32 inch should also work fine or better since the texts on this 27\" screen are clear more than enough. For video watching, you might want to try another model if you expect better quality than a mediocre display... Overall, I am truly satisfied with the quality at this price for office use!!\n\nBTY, HDMI cable works right away once you connect it to my MBP. No need to install any additional software for AOC.", "It's been a long time since I bought a computer and decided to buy separate units. I cannot be more pleased with this monitor. I am not a gamer. I am nearly 70 and I am so pleased with the clarity and color of this screen. I would highly recommend it. It is still fairly new. So, I don't know how time will change it, but for right now. I am truly satisfied.", "Known good cable worked fine. Kept getting \"no signal\" message. Monitor is great.", "If you\u2019re in the hunt for a low-cost 4K monitor, this should definitely hit your radar. I\u2019m loving its 350 nits brightness, especially when watching video feeds. It\u2019s a vast improvement over my previous 250 nit 4K monitor. The extra nits allow for greater contrast and deeper blacks. Performance-wise, it\u2019s a good monitor.\nThe settings menu system is a bit funky, but nothing a person with a bit of sense can\u2019t deal with. The manual isn\u2019t of much help, only stating the obvious. Once you\u2019ve figured things out and made your selections, most of what you\u2019ll need will be controlled by the joystick power switch on the back, which is simple.\nMany AOC monitors have Philips counterparts that are internally identical. In the case of the AOC U2790VQ, the counterpart is the Philips 276E8VJSB. Besides costing less, the Philips also comes with a 4 year advance replacement warranty, though I have no idea how well Philips stands behind it.\nWhy did I buy the AOC rather than the Philips? For health reasons I need a monitor whose height can be adjusted. Neither the AOC nor the Philips comes with a height-adjustable stand. The AOC has a VESA mount, though\u2014and the Philips does not. It's a snap to replace the stand that comes with the AOC with a good, solid, inexpensive VESA stand. The base-hinged stands that come with these monitors aren\u2019t nearly as firm.\nAlso, the cables are hidden better with the AOC than with the Philips. But that's a quibble.\nNote: you could get the Philips 278E1A, which is virtually identical in specs to the 276E8VJSB and includes a VESA mount...but it\u2019s been impossible to buy without also incurring a $40\u201350 shipping fee. So it turns out not to be less expensive than the AOC.\nSo if you don't need a VESA mount or a really solid stand, go for the Philips monitor.\nIf the stand is an issue, like it was for me, it only takes another $50 or so to fix you up.", "Can't give it perfect score since FRAME RATE for highest res is ~60 and I also haven't had it long enough to give it 5 stars. But so far it's great purchase TEXT for FONTS is way easier to read even when smaller than my other screen. The DPI pixel increase is worth it. Colors most people especially men can see that many anyways so don't matter to me. But colors seem TRUE meaning R G B look good but of course can be adjusted. I give it a good rating too since not enough pixel damage if any when arrived so great shipping. TIP: For newbies always remember to let your monitor warm up to room temperature before using. The reason I bought this is this my SECOND AOC monitor which has lasted without failure yet pixel quality it's up to par anymore, but it was 3D monitor so I still have it as my secondary monitor floating in air here. The size of the 4K AOC is about right if you have a full size desk for gaming. If your not gaming but using it for work you still might want a bigger one. The gaming on a mid size desk or something might even want smaller so your field of view stays within unless your a young kid who sees with peripheral vision at same time.", "**ONE MONTH UPDATE**\n\nNot only was I depressed to find that the monitor is now more than $100 less than what I originally paid just over a month later, but now the HDMI ports don't seem to work at all. Just a week ago I was switching between DP and HDMI Port 1 to stream with no issue. But now? Nothing from the HDMI Ports.\n\nI've plugged in multiple devices and nada. In fact, when I even attempt to use my Elgato HD60 S+ in said HDMI, the device loses ITS signal, and I have to unplug the output HDMI and reboot the device. So I'm removing two of the stars from my original rating. It's a beautiful image, and if you need a budget 4K Displayport and can get it for less than $300 (as it's currently listed March 23 2021), by all means this monitor is fine. But don't expect it last...\n\n******\n\nSo, this is my 2nd AOC monitor as the first one I ordered was apparently the official ball of the World Cup before being delivered... Getting that mini-vent out of the way, let's start with the cons:\n\nI will say this is definitely a budget 10-bit 4k. It has a light-plastic casing, only 3 inputs (1 DP, 2 HDMI), and while it is 3/4 borderless, the display does not completely fill the screen. I've attached the monitor to a VESA desk mount (the mount is a full 100mm, fyi), and I feel like I need to be extra careful moving it. The other major issue is the 108% sRGB description is wrong; It is 100% sRGB, calibrated using a Spyder5 Elite. This is what I am most disappointed about, since I bought this for video color correction, and the other color ranges suffer in turn (pictures attached). I know if I want accurate an accurate range I'm going to have to really jump up, but for now, this is where my budget took me...\n\nThat said... For $400, you could do a whole lot worse. To the eye, the image is bright and vibrant. I've watched a few 4k60 videos online, as well as some 10-Bit 4K GH5 footage I shot, and I'm pleased with the presentation thus far. I'm going to do some gaming on it, but at 60hz, I'm mostly just looking for the cinematic vs response.\n\nI will come back to this review in about 6 months or so, as some of the reviews here to tend to have issues, and I want to keep as accurate an account as I can. I put up with a lot of BS to finally get this monitor, it's only right to now to my due diligence in giving and accurate review.", "Pros:\n\n- Price. You simply cannot find another product at a lower price that matches this quality.\n\n- The color accuracy out of the box is great. After professional calibration, it is excellent.\n\n- Easy tool-free assembly means you\u2019ll be up and running in a matter of minutes!\n\n- The screen is light in weight, especially for the size! Being a 27-inch display, you might expect it to weigh more, but the panel uses plastic, not glass. This makes it light and easy to carry, move.\n\n- This model also supports VESA mounts, if you want to add a flexible arm to your setup.\n\nCons:\n\n- The screen brightness is only okay, but that drawback only matters if there is direct sunlight where you are using it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend using with your back to a window, but otherwise, it is more than acceptable for indoor use.\n\n- Matte screens don\u2019t have the same depth or punch to them, in terms of contrast. For the price of this model however, I don\u2019t expect glass with anti-reflective coating. This is a minor drawback, but if you need maximum contrast, look elsewhere.\n\n- Pixel response. This is an IPS panel. The advantages of high color accuracy are countered by higher response cycles. This leads to minor ghosting, and is most apparent when objects on screen are white, and moving across a black background.\n\nI do not recommend this for gaming, and that\u2019s not the reason I bought it. If you are planning to use productivity and creative tools (e.g., Adobe CC, CAD, web design, etc.) this is easily the most bang for the buck. The screen will pull you into your work - seriously, 27-inches is basically the perfect size for these kinds of tasks.", "Background: I had been using a 2015 27\" iMac, with a pair matching 27\" Thunderbolt Displays. A few months ago I decided to \"upgrade\" to a 2013 \"trash can\" Mac Pro, which has been a superb computer. However, that meant I was down to 2 displays. I work from home and at any given time I have a LOT of docs and apps and Explorer windows open. I know it sounds greedy, but I had really gotten spoiled using 3 27\" displays.\n\nSo, I did some research and decided to pick up this AOC monitor. Unfortunately, I discovered too late that the 2013 Mac doesn't support HDMI 2.0, and that connecting the display directly to the Mac's HDMI port meant that I could only get 30Hz. The resolution was far from desirable.\n\nI picked up an active HDMI to mini adapter so that I could connect it to one of the Mac's Thunderbolt ports, as the Mac can support 6 Thunderbolt displays. But I found that even with scaling the display, it didn't quite match the two TB displays, and cursor movement was very jerky.\n\nI've decided to return the monitor and pick up an Apple Thunderbolt display instead.\n\nI would not say that this is a bad monitor at all. In fact, the picture quality and color were quite good for its price range. It's just not a suitable fit for my Mac Pro.\n\nI have learned over 40 years of using computers that you really do need your displays to match each other, and I didn't think this one through enough.", "I wanted to set up a homework desktop and this was the one I decided to go with. I am very happy with this monitor. Easy to install, pretty simple setup and I love the fact it has 5/6 different brightness settings which helps a lot. Sometimes I need the monitor to be dim and other times bright. Having that option is so helpful. It's also not that heavy. This works very well with my MACBOOK PRO M1 2022. If you're looking for a monitor, this it is. Go for it. Price is very reasonable compared to the quality you get. I have had it for almost a year now or may be more, It's still working absolutely beautifully.", "Light and easy to hook up to Apple M2 Computer. Much nicer than Apple monitor. It was recommended as the best and it really is.", "I had purchased a couple of other monitors and noticed that they caused a great deal of eye fatigue because they inconsistently reproduced the text I was trying to read. If you are looking for a simple monitor with good detail, this is the monitor for you. I\u2019m impressed with how much clearer text is on this monitor. Generally, it works very smoothly. I did have to turn up the brightness a little bit, but that might just be personal preference. Everything else on the market was 2 to 3 times more expensive. So far this is been a great deal. I\u2019ll come back if there any dependability issues.", "I'm sure some people may have concerns or questions bout the different ports. As the description says, there is one Display Port, HDMI 2.0, and HDMI 1.4. After some asking around and research, I would say be sure whether you really need two HDMI ports or not. The common port used would be the HDMI 1.4, and the stock HDMI cable that is in the box is a 1.4. If you plan on using the 2.0, I was told that you should be using the correct (speed) cable or you may lead to some problems. For those who attempt to plug in a HDMI and Display Port cable (opposite ends), it will only work in the HDMI 2.0 port to Display Port. However, you will lead into the refresh rate issue (your settings will tell you that your display is only 30hz). For a typical setup of HDMI 1.4 main or Display Port main, it will be 60hz (or slightly less but close). Color is amazing, but I do recommend using your Night light screen settings for your eyes' sake.", "Display is bright and crisp. No dead/stuck pixels that I can see.\n\nThe provided stand is flimsy: it doesn't take much table-shake to start the screen flapping back and forth. The screen has VESA mounting holes but the stand uses a tab-and-latch attachment, can only be installed in a landscape orientation, and offers only tilt adjustment. Be prepared to shell out for a better mounting solution.\n\n\"Frameless\" can be justified as almost no plastic bezel on three sides of the screen (the bottom edge is significantly wider). The display panel itself has a few mm of black border around the active area so butting two of these side-by-side creates more dead space down the middle than you might expect.\n\nI don't game on this so I can't comment on how it would perform. It's great for office work.\n\nDisplayPort seems to be especially picky about the cables, blacking out the display if it loses sync. The supplied DP-DP cable is probably fine, but if you need a miniDP-DP cable (my video card only has miniDP ports) be sure to get one that's rated for 4K@60Hz. I'm not using the HDMI port but I'd guess the same applies for HDMI cables.\n\nNo built-in speakers or USB hub. Understandable at this price point, and most people probably wouldn't end up using them anyway.\n\nNot enough hours to comment on durability but no issues so far.", "Excellent monitor for my security system. Clear picture from all cameras.", "The product has a specific mount attachment and does not allow for the use of other bases so the monitor can be raised or rotated. I called the manufacturer support number and was hung up on three times. No more AOC monitors for me.", "My prior setup was 4 x ASUS VS238H-P 23\" Full HD 1920x1080 monitors from 2013. They still work great but I wanted more resolution.\n\nI reviewed multiple monitors side by side. They were all from Amazon but were limited to supporting free returns, and non with inbuilt USB-C. One for example was a top report winner (LG 27UK650-W)\n\nMy goal is for work purposes not gaming. I also do video conferencing and watch streaming video. I did compare all playing 4K high-res videos on 2 monitors and a Macbook screen concurrently. It was impressive with all monitors in sync. I found no out of bounds coloring, slow syncing or choppiness.\n\nIn the end the savings of this monitor over other models let me purchase 3 instead of just 2 for my desk.\n\nI did not review any monitor with USB-C. The extra money was not IMO worth it. I did buy a j5create unit so I could run 3 4k monitors on my Macbook pro. With 3 monitors you must plug power into your laptop, you cannot daisy chain it, as it just cannot charge fast enough.\n\nIt does help to calibrate your monitors.\n\nThe stand for this monitor is it's biggest fault. As I mount my monitors I just discarded that, but if you want to place on desk with the provided stand, not great.\n\nIt takes a bit more than I wish in menu options to switch HDMI inputs on a monitor. I miss the easier multiple buttons of the single behind the screen one most monitors have.", "This is a great budget 4K monitor. Mine arrived packed well with no dead pixels, lines, or issues of any kind.\n\nMinor gripe: there's a bit of vignetting (I learned this term from another monitor review) towards the edges. So if you're displaying a light color full-screen, it will appear to fade/shadow out towards the side edges. I almost never work with a full-screen light color up, so I quickly got over this. I only noticed it in the first place because the very first window I maximized happened to be a plain text editor with a white background. I might rule this monitor out over that if I were doing graphics work full-screen, but I'm not so I'm not motivated to return it over a problem that doesn't really affect me.", "Purchased this for a little less than a week. Very satisfied with the purchase.\nI bought 2 of them (27\" 4k IPS) to replace a triple monitor setup (23\" 1080p IPS), the color and clarity are both upgraded, I tried 150% - 200% rescale (windows 10) and finalized with 175%, so far so good.\nActually at first 2 monitors both had bad backlight bleeding issues, so I requested replacement. Soon amazon contacted me and let me know there were no replacement due to the high volume demand. Changed replacement to return without any problem, and I purchased another 2. This time they are much better although some slight backlight bleeding still existed. For those who cares, BLB is almost inevitable for IPS panels and are not uncommon for VA and TN panels. I have seen lots of complaints while I was considering LG 4k. Also, this AOC used the same panel as Philips 4k 27\". DIfference is AOC has vesa mount but philips doesn't.\nOne thing I think is worth mentioning that all 4 monitors I have checked have ZERO dead pixels. Their serials are from 71xxx, 72xxx, to 75xxx and 76xxx, so the later manufactured monitors have slightly better panel quality, but with slightly worse outshell quality (quick connect stand has a bumpy corner). All in all, highly recommend this monitor for those who wants vesa mount, decent picture quality, and don't care about gaming.\nPersonally I would recommend 144hz - 240hz for gaming for better experience, 1080p or 1440p depending on your GPU. I myself play CSGO only with a 1080p 144hz and that kicks any 4k monitor's ass.", "For what it's worth, I bought this product (AOC 27\" 4K IPS monitor) on Amazon for a significantly lower price than its current list price of $340. Even at that price, I think this would be a great choice for a 4K productivity display, but at the price I paid for it the value is an order of magnitude higher than any other product on the market. I bought this product for my mother, who wanted a desktop computer to work from home.\n\nColors look great out of the box and the picture is very vibrant. It has a pretty bad IPS glow in low-light conditions, but nothing that affects the quality of the picture enough for me to take a star off. This is not a gaming display. Don't buy it for that. Of course you _can_ play games on it, but why? If you have a PC that can play games well at 4K, then you should look for a better monitor. Buy this display because you want a 4K monitor that has good image quality. It's that simple. Also remember that if you want to watch 60fps video, then you need to use the DisplayPort input or take care to make sure your HDMI connection can support 4K 60Hz.", "I mostly like this monitor. I'm mixed on picture quality because small print is fuzzy in some instances. But I wanted to warn against using the included software. The e-Saver tool began to shut down while I was actually sitting at the keyboard working. And - it seems hard to imagine, but i-Menu actually commandeers the Ctrl-W hotkey, which I use all the time - among other things, to close tabs in Firefox and to close Windows File Explorer windows.", "I bought a second not so long ago (the first in march 2020).\nGreat monitor for this money (~210$ I paid).\nThe only issue a can mention - the new one has lower minimal brightness in \"User\" mode and it's the only mode that allows you to set R/G/B values manually).\nBoth of them have similar brightness/gamma in sRGB mode (although not equal - on white color comparison there is a slightly different tint - green on the old monitor, red on the new)\nAlso, the new one has a calibration report for sRGB mode (avg.delta E = 0.53)\nThe on-screen menu button is on the back of the monitor, so it's hard to reach it, especially when you have two monitors mounted side by side.", "I bought 2 of them, one is still working fine, and the other started flickering lines across the screen.", "Pros:\n4k, no ghosting or color bleeding, text very clear at 4K, no dead pixels, $$.\nI have not noticed any page tearing at 3840x2160 60HZ.\nVESA mount is recessed, which could be a problem for some, but I was trying to hold as close to the wall as possible, and it worked out great with my mount.\n\nCons:\nInput select is a bit wonky.\nAs many others have stated, the sample image is a complete fantasy. The bezel is tiny, but the display border is about .25\", making the display area more like 26.75\". If you are planning a multi-monitor setup, keep the total .5\" gap in mind.\nThe display port works, but not for everything. Older macbooks have some issue with it, but the MacPro 6,1 is ok. HDMI seems fine with everything I tried.", "It hasn't done anything wrong yet, but one time I turned it on and it had a bunch of jumbled pixels. Another time I think it black screen mid use. But other than these weird freakouts it hasn't shown any more signs in the months I've used it. Picture quality is good and everything, but I wouldn't recommend a 4K panel specifically for gaming.\n\n*Edit, after using it as a second monitor for almost a year it has burn-in... I didn't even run it that bright. I did keep it on many of the same images and tabs, so I guess it makes sense... still sucks that it's already no good for watching stuff though.", "I've been using these monitors a lot more than I thought I would since the recent COVID-19 outbreak has me working from home. My coworkers were initially encouraging me to buy a 144Hz 1080p monitor, but I really wanted the 4K resolution for development and eventually gaming with a 4K capable Xbox. So far, doing software development on these has been a dream! I have been getting a flawless picture with great color all at 60FPS. I bought two monitors and my work laptop can drive both easily. They came boxed with HDMI 2.0 and Display Port cables, which was a nice surprise. Gaming on my Xbox One at 1080p looks great too, but I can't wait to try hooking up Series X to it once they come out.\n\nThe only drawback is that they're not truly edge-less as some reviews have noted. There's about a 1/4\" (less than 1cm) black border around edge of the screen. Given the price and otherwise quality of these monitors, I am okay with the trade-off.\n\nOverall, another quality product at an astounding price by AOC. Would definitely recommend for anyone who's going to be working from home for the next month or so, and wants a 4K monitor to boost their productivity.", "This review is from someone who is NOT a monitor aficionado. I just wanted to upgrade my 10 yr old home office monitor to a budget-friendly 4K monitor that was at least 24 inches. In 2020, I understand that budget-friendly and 4K probably shouldn't be used in the same sentence. BUT for a simple office monitor, you can't beat this one.\n\nSo far, I've had this monitor for six months. From what I can tell, the quality is more than satisfactory. Being VESA compliant wasn't part of my criteria, but it was definitely a bonus. In fact, being VESA compliant is what ultimately won me over vs a comparable budget-friendly monitor I was considering.\n\nIf I could, I would dock half star for the knob located on the backside for two reasons.\n1) I question how durable that thing is and 2) it's not so obvious that it controls everything.\n\nOverall, I think 80% of people would be happy to have this monitor. I'm so happy with it, I bought a second just a few months later.", "Just a heads up to those purchasing this, the 4k 27\" version does not have a VGA input despite what amazon and the AOC website states. It comes with the 2 HDMI inputs and the display port input. (EDIT: It looks like amazon has removed VGA from the description, but it is still stated to include VGA on the AOC website.)\n\nThat being said, this is a great monitor. I am very happy with it. I live in a small studio apartment and this is the only monitor/TV in my place, so it has to be able to do it all, and for me it does. I have my PS4 Pro and Switch hooked up through the HDMI ports and the picture is fantastic. My laptop is hooked up via display port and also looks great at 4k resolution. No gray uniformity issues, no missing pixels. The menu is easy to navigate and allows a minimal amount of picture control. I do wish it had a bluetooth transmitter built in, but I use an inexpensive dongle and it works just great.\n\nIf you are looking for a functional 27\" 4k monitor, and you aren't super picky about refresh rate, then this is the one I would go with.", "I purchased this monitor for a home security system. At first it seemed OKish... Not what I expected out of a 4K system. But I'm learning the system as I go. It wasn't until I confirmed my camera system did support audio that I realized the monitor is broken. Absolutely no audio out of this monitor. I tried 2 HDMI cables and confirmed it's just the monitor that has no audio. No help form Amazon. 3 days out of my return window and Amazon will do nothing. Even though it was 60 days from order date when it expired, it took 2 weeks for delivery. I should still have 2 more weeks but they will not budge. Thanks Amazon. Very disappointing customer service. Now I need to deal with AOC. To be continued...\n** Update ** AOC promptly responded to my correspondence regarding the audio. This monitor does not have internal speakers but a jack for optional speakers. I feel like a jerk now. I wish the documentation was more clear. I upped the rating to 3 stars. Poor instructions. Decent image.", "I've had this monitor for 12 days now. I included a picture of my rather cluttered setup so you might feel better about your organizational efforts. \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe VESA mount was one essential for me since I often need to swing the monitor out of the way to get to the drawers in my roll top desk.\n\nImage quality is great as far as I can tell. The only thing keeping it from five stars is that you pretty much need to be straight on to it to get the best image. Thet might be a problem for some people in their situations, but is not at all a problem for me.\n\nI was a little leery of getting a 4K monitor for this low of a price, but so far, I'm very impressed. I hope I'm still impressed in a couple years.", "Get this monitor for the monitor, not the stand. The stand is cheap junk. If you want a monitor with a stand that is adjustable, then don't get this monitor; or, get this monitor and then buy a separate, adjustable stand, which I'm probably going to do, which makes me mad. You can't raise the stand up or down, only tilt it a bit. Whatever...", "Prior to my purchase and subsequent disappointment, I read through all of the reviews for this monitor, especially those reviews where customers received defective AOC monitors, but my desperation to find a reasonably priced 4K monitor that was favorably reviewed on YouTube got the best of me and I placed my order. Essentially my understanding after my research was that this was a great monitor display because it was 4K with so so build quality but for the price. FYI, it appears that the price increased from last year (not supply and demand related) and it seems as though quality decreased.\n\nSo I rolled the dice and placed an order for an AOC U2790VQ 27\" 4K 3840x2160 UHD Frameless Monitor which took longer than promoted by Amazon (5 days and not 3 days). Unfortunately, upon receipt, right out of the box the monitor did not function. The monitor turned on but it would not recognize any of my computers (PC and Macs each running with different OS versions) with different types of cable connections and ports (Display Port \"DP\", HDMI to HDMI, DP to DP, Mini DP to DP, etc.). This particular AOC monitor had 2 HDMI ports and 1 DP, and yes, I connected to all of the ports with no success.\n\nSo I called the manufacturer and I explained the issue I was having with the monitor where I was immediately informed that the unit was defective. I returned the unit same morning which was required for working at home and now I am searching for another monitor in a pinch where most monitors in this price range and specs are sold out. There was not any damage to the box and I watched the UPS driver gently place the boxed monitor right inside my front door. Of course, who knows what happened during transit by the shipper.\n\nThe monitor was well packed, assembly was very simple and easy, shipped with no owner's manual (a download online from manufacturer website) but for a very small diagram paper quick assembly start manual that was included, a QC chart stating that all the pixels were tested and working for the serial number of my particular unit, a sheet of paper regarding warranty and manufacturer information, one HDMI to HDMI cable and one DP to DP cable. Although new and shiny, it was obvious that the build quality of the unit was suspect but at least you could look forward to a great screen to view at 4K which you could tilt about 5 +/- degrees if only and only if you happened to receive a functioning unit.", "I am overly picky with my monitors or phone display. I am iPhone user just because apple displays are really good. This monitor out of the box is really good for the avg user who hate glossy displays or overly bright displays. I was looking for a 1440 p monitor but the cost on the monitor is too good. I have mine on 1440p and only plan to use 4k for watching movies. Different people want different things out of a monitor. If you are looking for a glossy display or gaming monitor then you probably want a different monitor. If you want a good IPS display with Mate finish than this one is a good one.", "Let me first say that I am a long-time user of AOC's monitors, and quality-wise I am a fan. That includes this model too. Honestly, I think I just had bad luck this time. I got these 2 monitors as the basis for my home office, and currently have them hooked up to my business laptop through a DELL Docking station. My only real complaint is that one of them seems to have some sort of shaking affecting it. If I were to hesitate a guess, I would say that the laptop was not able to successfully handle the two monitors simultaneously.\nI have already done some basic troubleshooting though and the shake still persists, at this point, I have already contacted Amazon for a replacement because the other monitor works like a dream.\n\nSo, for anyone who is considering this monitor, I feel I can give my recommendation. Just be aware that its got the shakes, you should just call Amazon about it.", "I bought this monitor after hooking up my PC to my living room 4K TV to try out some games, in 4K for the first time. From there, I was hooked on 4K gaming and had to find a monitor. Coming from a 32in 144hz gaming monitor, and seeing how expensive 32in 4K monitors are, I decided to down size a tad and go with AOC. I've always had good luck with their products in the past and pulled the trigger on this monitor.\n\nThis monitor is beautiful, thin, rich in color and detail. I have not had one issue with it whatsoever. I plugged my PC in with DVI and never had an issue or complaint. Using it for photo/video editing to gaming/simulations, it's flawless. I have even plugged in a 4K Roku stick to watch streaming services from bed. If you're looking for a great, simple, plug and play 4K monitor, get this. By the end of the day, you can save money on a big fancy 4K, 1ms, 144hz monitor and get a cheaper, high quality monitor like this one and never notice a difference.", "I liked this monitor so much i bought a second one for a dual display. Unfortunately, the monitor was defective on arrival. Will go to store to buy it if it's still available.", "I had researched heavily to find a good 4k monitor for general use, and audio production. 27\" is probably the smallest you'd want to invest in, as 4k even scaled to 150% resolution, is decently small.\n\nThis monitor has been great so far, albeit I've had it for only a few months. It doesn't have freesync, is only 60hz, and a slightly bigger bezel than advertised, but the cons stop there.\n\nIf you're looking for a 4k monitor on a budget with excellent colors, great viewing angles, and a bright crisp IPS display, I think this is the way to go. I vesa mounted it right away, so I can't speak to the stand quality too much, but hey, again, at this price point, I'm surprised it came with vesa compatability at all.\n\nEnjoying it for everything from movies, browsing, and production so far. I probably wouldn't have chosen this model if I wanted to game with it, though.", "I am visually impaired software developer searching for a upgrade/replacement monitor for my computer. I had previously owned a Benq monitor, However, although the BenQ i was using was great, in the past I was always purchased AOC monitors. I was always impressed with AOC brand.\ndid a lot or research and read reviews about this monitor and it looks that most of them were positive. I was contemplating whether to with another BenQ or go with AOC.\nMy final decision was to purchase this monitor. WoW if have to say that first off the monitor was shipped quickly and was able to set it up in less than 10 minutes. Furthermore, I was blown away at the video quality was so much better than the old BenQ. More specifically; less eye strain, text is easier to read, photos and videos are showing more details, I absolutely love the one rocker type witch on the back of the monitor for adjusting the settings and I can even see more color details.\nThe only issue with the product (small one) is that you cannot adjust the height of the monitor.", "I love AIC as a company, but reviews said it supported 4K on aPS5 and it doesn\u2019t. I even bought the recommended HDMI2 cable!", "Don't buy it for gaming. The refresh rate is not any better that cheap monitor and most video cards cannot drive 4K well anyway. When paired with a non-4K monitor, you will get some weird resizing anomalies as you move windows from one screen to another. Windows will scale everything up on it (and not scaling leaves text so small you literally cannot read it). Forget trying to share a window on 2 screens, you will get a headache. Unless you are doing very intricate art I would not buy it. If you are looking for a gaming monitor, get something with a higher refresh rate (120 or 144hz) - you will be much happier.. If your computer can drive 4K and you just want watch video or work on hirez art, then this would be a good choice. There is nothing wrong with this monitor - it works and I use one everyday - but I wish I would have gotten something with a faster refresh instead of 4K.", "I am very happy with this purchase. I am a part time pro and upgraded from a lower resolution monitor. I post process everything and find this monitor to work well. My video card allows the full 4K resolution and it is fantastic. Are there better monitors out there for photography, of course but it is great for most with a little careful set up.\n\nStraight out of the box I changes the picture mode to Sports to get the brightness up to a proper level. I also changed the color temperature to cool and then used my video card software to slightly tweak the colors. Perfect.\n\nThe packaging is excellent and everything is individually wrapped and got here perfectly. The joystick on the back to make all the adjustments is fantastic, and the build quality is great all the way around. I most heartily recommend this monitor for photography and general use. Copy and text is flawless and it is just about impossible to see the individual LED's. It also comes with cables which is a great bonus.", "I use this monitor at home primarily for work. I use Bluebeam Revu a lot to review construction plans, and the resolution of 4k makes this task far better than lower resolution screens, and that's why I finally bought a 4k monitor. Picture quality seems quite good, but not great. I love the increased resolution- it's so much more useful than a lower-res monitor, as I can see about 3x the amount of plan volume. However, the resolution appears a little \"soft\". Not quite fuzzy, but not crisp. Ideally, I would have liked a monitor with very crisp delineation of each pixel, but I'm sure that costs 2x-3x of what this monitor cost. So overall I'm satisfied. It's good for the price point, it scratches the itch. But I can't exactly rave about it's awesomeness.", "I love the thin bezel on these screens, it makes them look great side by side.

But the LG monitors are expensive. So when faced, in one case, with a need to replace a 1080p60 with a 4K60 monitor for as little cost as possible I started looking around and found this monitor. I was NOT disappointed. I now have two favorites. I still think the LG 27UK850-W is the best 27\" 4K60 monitor out there, especially if you need USB-C input, but you cannot go wrong with the AOC for DisplayPort or HDMI applications.

This leaves the center as a bright spot. One unit arrived with faint, but visible horizontal lines across the display that don't seem to be from shipping (the panel itself is wholly intact.) A shame, because colors are fantastic and the price was very much right.

It came quickly (before the computer), was easy to set up and hook up, and cost half the price of the Apple screen I was looking at. If you aren't editing video or needing highest resolution, this is the best screen and nothing comparable in price comes close. Connection is HDMI only, so you may need a connector depending on what you own.", "Set clear vision strong, not off , as by default if you deal with small font. It works good with dual HDMI input from two laptops (home & work). Joystick on the right is very convenient.", "Once you've gone 4k, you'll never go back. For the price, this monitor is absolutely amazing.\n- On my MacBook Pro, I first tried native 4k, and everything was way to small. After picking an appropriate scaling level, not only do I get tons more real-estate, but everything is clear and easy to read.\n- On my PC, Windows 10 auto chose 150% scaling, and it seems to be just right. Again, everything is crisp and clear.\n\nI'm not really much of a gamer, and my GTX950 certainly isn't up to the task of driving this monitor at 4k for any modern games, but running games at 1080p look fabulous on this large screen. The 5ms response time is more than adequate for any gaming I would do, though a hard-core gamer might want better.\n\nThis monitor turned out to be so good, I ordered a second one.", "CHEAP QUALITY.\nAll 3 that I've had have broken/dead vertical lines in them. I originally bought 2. 1 started showing dead vertical lines within 2 months, and the other started showing lines after 12 months. AOC repaired (did not replace) the 1st one under warranty but would not cover the same issue on the other because the warranty had lapsed by a week. Then the repaired one got the same broken/dead vertical lines within 6 months of the repair.\n\nNOT FOR DUAL MONITOR SETUP.\nDon't be fooled by AOC's misleading pictures. The bezels around the actual image are larger than the AOC's pictures. The pictures show tiny bezels, but the bezels are actually 5/16 inch (8mm) on top and sides, and the bottom bezel sticks out some. So when you set up 2 monitors together, you can expect about a 1 inch (~25mm) gap between the image on one screen and the image on the other screen. Only if you have the monitors completely flat (which is not how anyone wants them set up), there is a MINIMUM of 5/8 inch (16mm) gap between the images. When you angle the monitors to face you (as you should), the bottom bezel on each monitor sticks out and hits the other monitor's bezel, creating a visible gap between the monitors.", "What can I say, this monitor has been really good to me. I'm on the cusp of buying another... but it does take up a lot of desk space. If it matters, I typically work in PS, AI, Premiere, AE, and sometimes C4D.\n\nPros:\n- I don't notice any \"dark\" spots around the edges/corners\n- Colors are finer than Raquel Welch in the 60's.\n- It's been reliable 6+ months now\n\nCons:\n- It's size means that it is backlit like a motherrr.

I was initially surprised by the price and amount of positive reviews, so I bought it, and I have only been impressed since using it.\n\nI bought this monitor to use mainly for graphic design work and I can say it very much works well for this purpose. Before I was using a 1080p monitor with lackluster colors and contrast, and I found myself avoiding using it for anything besides notes and work calls. The Phillips monitor on the other hand feels like a close enough match to the quality of my MacBook Pro display that I can actually work on graphic elements on it and be able to trust their accuracy - I usually still double check any design on the MBP display before sending it off to a client, but the extra real estate is still definitely a win especially for working on projects over extended periods of time.\n\nI included a video and some images to show how this monitor compares to the MBP display; hopefully these speak for themselves as far as brightness, contrast, blacks, color brilliance, sharpness/clarity, anti-glare coating, and fluidity of motion are concerned.\n\nHighly recommend the purchase! It was the best budget option I could find. Now if only they would make this with a glass screen instead of the anti-glare \ud83d\ude0f\n\nPS:\nI have to agree with what others have been saying about the screen controls being hard to use. Every time I open this menu I found myself fumbling around in it. About the only real con I have though!\n\n05/23 Update:\nI ran into a problem with the monitor where nearly every time I plugged it into my MacBook Pro the MacBook would completely freeze and need to be hard shut down to continue to work on it. Luckily this was not a problem with the monitor itself, but rather a problem with the Elgato adapter/the MacBook\u2019s ability to handle this connection. I googled around and it turns out ever since a certain MacOS update a few years ago, certain connections cause MBPs to have a kernel panic. Ridiculous, but for me switching to a USB-C to HDMI cable solved any problems I was having.", "V\u00ed opiniones muy divididas, unos que era muy buen monitor y por otro lado que estaba descalibrado y no vale la pena.\nLo regres\u00e9 a Amazon, te explico c\u00f3mo usuario en qu\u00e9 caso es conveniente y en qu\u00e9 caso no...\nSi eres creador de contenido, dise\u00f1ador, fot\u00f3grafo, vidiografo o cualquier actividad que necesites estar creando contenido NO LO COMPRES, pues viene descalibrado y a ojo no se puede calibrar, y comprar un calibrador no es opci\u00f3n, a menos que consigas rentado un calibrador, el color morado casi ni lo reproduce, los blancos tiene tinte verdosos y con toque magenta pero el color magenta se inclina m\u00e1s hacia el cinan, las tonalidades de verde son como plana y se inclina a verde pistache, reproduce en exceso los colores pastel, es m\u00e1s como una pantalla gigante y cuando terminaba de usarla acababa con los ojos rojos, c\u00f3mo si te acercarlas a una smar TV a 30cm de ella por horas, y terminar\u00e1s encandilado, cansado y al bajarle el brillo vuelve a cambiar todos los colores.\nPorque SI DEBES COMPRARLA, porque es un monitor de TV, y si consumes mayormente pel\u00edculas en 4k, YouTube, Netflix, series y en ocasiones usas tu PC para ver correos, a una distancia de 70cm o m\u00e1s, ah\u00ed es su nicho, da mucho detalle, normalmente las TV vienen calibradas para mejorar la experiencia y no para tener colores fieles, el sangrado es casi inexistente, (cuando pones la pantalla en negro en IPS normalmente da una uniformidad de grises) y creo que esa calibraci\u00f3n de colores le da un plus de nitidez al 4k y si es 4k a un precio muy accesible con 10bits,(miles de millones de colores) no vi vi\u00f1etas que molesten.\nIncluso est\u00e1 posicionado en pcmomitors.com como el mejor para ver pel\u00edculas, solo tienes que ajustar la gama porq viene con colores algo p\u00e1lidos y para ver pel\u00edculas se necesita mayor intensidad de color.\nConcluyo: Es un monitor de TV de 4k sin bocinas, el cual no est\u00e1 hecho para verlo a tan corta distancia, y los colores est\u00e1n hechos para dar alta definici\u00f3n, (colores contrastantes) pero no para representar colores fieles.", "El producto desafortunadamente me lleg\u00f3 con falla en la pantalla, en un inicio se cargaba como se ve en la foto que tom\u00e9 y despu\u00e9s recuperaba imagen pero a\u00fan se pod\u00edan percibir ciertas \u201cl\u00edneas\u201d.

Even at $300, it's a healthy contender for display quality and color balance with monitors even in the $400 range. Of course, there's a reason it's cheaper than those monitors, namely 60Hz, no USB-C (i.e., sorry Macbooks), no additional USB ports and no speakers. It also uses an AC Adapter, rather than integrated power supply. If you're fine with those caveats, you are going to have a hard time finding a better quality display at this price point. If your heart is set on the missing features, then check out the Samsung U28R55 or Asus VG289Q; both use the exact same 28\" Innolux panel. However, according to other reviews, Philips seems to have the best factory calibration for color balance and white levels. Out of the box, my Spyder 4 Pro (yeah, yeah, I haven't upgraded that yet) found it quite accurate, although it was a smidge cooler with the default 6500K with Gamma 2.2 setting. A quick calibration fixed that and brought the sRGB level to full coverage, 87% DCI-P3 and 82% Adobe RGB. For comparison, the Philips' DCI-P3 and Adobe values are about 6% higher than the $300-ish Asus Proart PA278QV. So for most color work, it's very good. (If you need higher percentages, you're in the wrong price bracket). Don't forget to install the drivers from Philips' website, along with SmartControl (yes, it's actually useful - you can do all the monitor adjustments from Windows so you don't have to reach around back to use the joystick). After calibration, there's a tiny bit of saturation in the reds, but it's not super obvious and it makes for a very pleasant image that pops, but it's not over the top and unrealistic. The panel coloring is pretty even, although I can tell it's a tiny bit cooler on the far left than the far right side, but I have to really look for it. For this price point, it's stellar.\n\nThe stand is surprisingly rock solid and heavy. Making adjustments is easy and it feels very sturdy. I was pleased to see the monitor had vertical adjustment, going as low as 1\" above from the desk surface. Vertical and tilt adjustments were solid and I really like the stand, but it is a bit bulky so I mounted it to the wall with a standard 100mm VESA. Overall construction is very solid, even if it's mostly plastic. Philips didn't skimp on the important things like durability. My only gripe (and it's minor) is the lack of an integrated power supply. But, as a result, the back of the monitor is very thin, so there is at least an aesthetic gain from this design decision. The cord for the AC adapter is long enough to hide it out of sight.\n\nWhile it came with an HDMI cable, I used a DisplayPort cable and Windows 11 recognized it instantly and even adjusted the scaling to a recommended 150%. With this setting, this monitor is a Goldilocks size, with very sharp, readable text and a lot of space to work with. For me, the boost from a 1080 monitor to 4K was fantastic. My only regret is that I didn't make the switch sooner. Everything is so much sharper and easier on my eyes, especially if you do a lot of reading/typing. If you're on the fence, definitely consider this monitor. As to long term, I hope it lasts, but from what I paid, it's about half of what I was expecting to pay for a decently color-balanced monitor with 4K.

Funny how 43\" 4k tvs are going for the same price as 15-27\" 4K? It's ridiculous. Anywho from the avail choices in 2023 this Phillips 28in 4K monitor spec wise is probably the best choice we got, the vesa mounts are not blocking anything and the screen is an inch bigger than the 27\" which makes a big difference in esthetics (looks nicer than 27\"). It has 2 HDMI's and a Display connection too. The frame is super thin so it has a smooth look, the picture is bright enough that you never have to worry about brightness and the picture and color are simply amazing. I know 4K tvs, monitors and 4k portable monitors and the picture on this monitor is worth every penny of $250 the price I got it for, once you use this monitor you won't go back to 1080p for sure. I would recommend this monitor because it's cheap good quality and I highly recommend Philips brand since their LEDs are long lasting and very sharp. I also have a 53in Philips 4k and I've never had a better tv.

Either a scrambled screen or glitching back and forth in a stuttering movement. Once I turn it off and on again its fine, it's just annoying because it happens 40%-50% of the time. That same monitor also had a weird issue where I couldn't scroll up using the \"joystick\" button on the back and the color was off but that seems to have gone away when I got a new display port cable. That shouldn't matter but somehow it fixed the \"joystick\". I'm running it all off a brand new dell workstation with a brand new RTX 3070 so all should be good.\n\nAlso The power button on the back must be held for a few seconds to turn off/on.

I'm not a fan of the settings buttons being on the back--very hard to reach when you have monitors next to each other. I also wish it had a DVI/ VGA port just in case I needed backwards compatibility to old systems. The only other problem is they take a long time to resume from standby/low power/whatever mode, which is annoying when your computer use varies all through the day and every time you resume, you have to wait an extra few seconds. Also, there is still a stupid Windows 10 bug that over displayport in multimonitor, windows move to the non-displayport monitor everytime the system resumes. But this is not Philips fault.

Beim ersten Bild, welches ich auf dem Viewsonic Monitor bearbeitet habe, fiel mir sofort die sensationell gute Farbtreue auf. Die Farben wirken \u00e4u\u00dferst nat\u00fcrlich, was mich als ambitionierten Hobbyfotograf sehr freut. Sollte einem die nat\u00fcrliche Farbdastellung nicht zusagen, so bietet der Monitor verschiedene Modi und Einstellungsoptionen.\n\nAls Gelegenheitszocker war ich nat\u00fcrlich auch auf die Gaming-Leistung gespannt. Auch hier schneidet der Monitor absolut \u00fcberzeugend ab, zumindest f\u00fcr einen Hobbyspieler. Klar, es gibt im Jahr 2022 sicher besseres als 60Hz, allerdings m\u00fcsste man zuerst mal eine derart potente Hardware haben, um AAA Games mit mehr als 60fps darzustellen. Mir und meinen Augen gen\u00fcgen definitiv auch 60Hz um ein f\u00fcr mich ansprechendes Spielerlebnis zu bilden.\nNun ist es nat\u00fcrlich so, dass es viele gibt, denen 60Hz nicht ausreichen - dann sollte man definitiv zu einem anderen Monitor greifen.\n\nIch sitze gut 60-70cm vom Bildschirm weg, die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe finde ich f\u00fcr diese Distanz absolut in Ordnung.

Die Farbdarstellung ist klasse. Diverse Modi lassen verschiedene M\u00f6glichkeiten zu. Gaming ist f\u00fcr den Hobbyspieler auch m\u00f6glich. Fotobearbeitung ist spitze und macht Laune. Andere Ger\u00e4te kosten teilweise ein vielfaches mehr und bilden auch nicht unbedingt besser ab. Von daher freue ich mich sehr \u00fcber den Kauf.

As such, I did my due diligence and my pros and cons did not justify the $600+ price difference between this Viewsonic and the BenQ. I use a Herman Miller monitor arm and therefore have no need for the metal base of the BenQ PD3220U (base is metal and stand is plastic). Similarly, a built in KVM switch is a nice to have NOT a must have for me, and lastly, I'm not willing to shell out $1K+ for a display that would soon be outdated by IPS Black or 32 inch 5K offerings (crossed fingers).\nIn light of that, I've used Viewsonic CRT monitors at work in the 90s but this is the first one I've owned \u2013 so far so good (knock on wood). In my experience, the Colorpro VP3256-4K has features and capabilities that closely if not exceed that of the BenQ PD3220U for $600+ less.

However, if you do delve into adjusting this monitor, get ready to spend some serious time. The first thing you'll probably do is to change the Brightness. Well, good luck to ya. It doesn't work. You can't adjust even on the monitor itself where the OSD option is grayed out and you're given no hint why or how to enable it. Downloading and installing the vDisplay Manager will leave you even more frustrated. Just finding where the Brightness can be adjusted is enfuriating. You'd think it under Basic->ImageAdjust... but noo, it's under Basic->ColorAdjust. Go figure. And as a side remark, in ColorAdjust there's not a single adjustment for color. But you do find Brightness and Contrast. Super you think, just what I need. Well go ahead and adjust all you want, and btw, the controls work. The sliders work. There's just a small problem. The display's image remains unchanged. So you can google all you want how to fix this issue and even on Viewsonic's homepage there's no help to be found.. or at least it was illusive to me. I eventually found a side comment by a repair guy who responded, on some faq blog, to another persons question about how to enable the Brightness control. He said something about that some HDR monitors do not allow you control the Brightness. I was like, so why didn't Viewsonic highlight this somewhere?? It's not mentioned in their user manual. In fact they hardly even mention HDR in the user manual even though there are controls for it on the monitor... but no controls for it in vDisplay Manager. Yeah, you heard me. So inconsistent. So I went ahead and tried disabling HDR and bingo now Brightness works... however at the cost of an absolutely fuzzy unclear doll looking picture. And the brightness only went up slightly. So all this frustration for an even worse performing picture quality. On top of this, the thunderbolt cable they supplied is junk. And finally, the speakers are absolute crap.

The PC would just crash at random without rhyme or reason. Tried different solutions such as plugging the power supply directly to the wall outlet instead of the surge protector, uninstalled and reinstalled all my video card and sound card drivers thinking it was conflicts with drivers, but no, the crash and reboot still kept happening despite all that.\n\nAfter Googling extensively for a solution for weeks, I finally narrowed down the problem to the DisplayPort cable that came included with the monitor. Just Google \"The DisplayPort Pin 20 Problem\" to understand the underlying issue. But the jist of it is, most if not all Monitor manufacturers, even one as reputable as ASUS, sometimes still include very generic and sub-par quality Displayport cables with the 20 PIN still \"live\".\n\nOnce I changed the included DP cable for a higher quality one from Cable Matters (Ivanky is also a good brand which I'm using on my LG monitor), the crashes went away and the Kernel-Power issue never happened again.\n\nSo don't cheap out on the DisplayPort cable (looking at you, ASUS!), it actually matters!

So far, this new monitor is simply a dream; hopefully it holds up as well as my older asus monitor! While this is not one of those ultra high tier gaming monitors with 1ms response time, and I don\u2019t game super seriously, I am personally very picky, so I can imagine for even very discerning professional gamers, this will meet or likely exceed your needs for performance. The only exception I would say is if money is no object and you have an SLI/crossfire setup you want to dedicate its full output to one monitor...in that case I\u2019d say go for one of those ultra high refresh rate/1ms/4K(or higher) systems, but for 99% of people out there, even for most professionals, this is a fantastic monitor. I, at least, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it so far.", "El monitos es bonito, se siente y se ve incre\u00edble. Me la he pasado bastante bien jugando en \u00e9l. Los botones de atr\u00e1s son lo \u00fanico que no me encanta.", "A mi hijo le encanto este aparato, calidad, ya no lo puedo quitar de la pantalla!!", "Finally I found a great monitor with no backlight bleeding. It has some ips glow but that is ok, as the black levels in this monitor is the best I have seen in an ips monitor so far.\n\nSecond of all, people are complaining about HDR being washed out for 2 reasons 1- They are using HDR on non supported HDR games 2- Or they are playing a game that has terrible HDR implementation to begin with, and a good example for such a game is Red Dead redemption 2 which looks terrible and washed out when HDR is turned on(this is even for the best HDR TVs as it is a game issue and not a monitor or a TV issue), but you can still fix this issue by tinkering with your PS4's HDR calibration settings. Games that I have tried on this monitor and look great with HDR for PS4 pro are(Spider man, God of war, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon zero of Dawn).\n\nMost importantly I do not understand why is this not vesa hdr certified while LG UK, UN and UL series are. For one, the LG monitors in the series I have listed and that have the \"400\" hdr certification, do not even exceed 350 nits(Their peak brightness is 350 nits, just as high as this Asus monitor) which is funny because both the Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q and the LG 27UK, UN and UL series are all 350 nits max, but for some reason the LG was able to acquire a Vesa 400 certification for its HDR, but the Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q, which has the same amount of nits(350), did not acquire this certification.\n\nAll in all this is a great monitor that has the best black levels for an IPS monitor and it is of better quality than the more expensive LG27UK, Ul and UN series. Its black levels are very impressive and makes any game that much more atmospheric and immersive, regardless of the resolution. For example, Cyberpunk on PC, set at 1080p, actually looks great on this monitor due to the black levels (without HDR).\n\n-The Cons, What are they?\n\n1-The Buttons and the Display options are kinda terrible and inaccessible/nonintuitive.\n\n2-No volume buttons or wheel, so you actually have to go into the OSD(on screen display options) in order to get into the volume section to turn your volume up or down.\n\n3- It does not come with an HDMI cable and only comes with a Display Port cable.\n\n4- Terrible wire connection locations(vertically placed in the back rather than horizontally, which LG monitors win in this department)\n\n5- And lastly there is no quick buttons for input changes. You still have to go into the menu in order to change your input from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2 to Display Port and vice versa.\n\nSo good thing non of the cons have to do anything with the actual image quality because this monitor performs very well in that department. I feel they skimped on these technical issues in order to give you an Amazing display for this price, so the shortcuts that were made to offer such an amazing picture for this price, are mostly the cons I have listed, and It did not come at the expense of image quality which is great.\n\nOf course many people would add 60hertz as a \"con\" but for gamers who are not planning to play games higher than 60fps, then there is no reason to consider this a con. It is only a con for people who care more about performance in multiplayer games, than about image quality. And no, the new consoles will not take advantage of monitors with higher refresh rates in triple A tittles and only a few games will even run at 4k 120 hertz on the xbox series x or the PS5. It is a gimmick that you should not base your monitor shopping decision on. I mean the PS5 box states \"8k\"...does that mean that games will run at 8k on PS5 and that you should go out and now buy an 8k TV to \"future proof\" yourself? lol of course not. Gimmick advertising is a thing children.", "Excelente calidad de imagen HD, lo \u00fanico que quedo a deber es el audio, yo siento que es bajo a\u00fan cuando le subo al maximo, por lo demas excelente", "NOTE: This review is for the VG289Q - not the ASUS VG28UQL1A. Not sure why Amazon has combined these reviews, but please be aware of this.\n\nI bought this monitor to pair with my newly purchased PS5. In short, the image looks fantastic, crisp and smooth - especially when playing games that support 60fps. The only shortcoming is that it does not process PS5 HDR correctly. If you choose to turn on HDR in your ps5 settings, the resultant image will likely be washed out. Furthermore, you will unable to be tweak the image by using the on-screen monitor settings (contrast, color, etc) because they become \"greyed out\" and inoperable when the PS5's HDR is turned on. My solution was to actually turn off HDR in my PS5 menu and just let the monitor itself process the image.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning the peak performance you can get with this monitor is 60fps. That wasnt an issue for me, but I figured I'd mention it to those looking for faster frame rates.\n\nIf HDR isn't a big deal with you, then this is otherwise a decent gaming monitor. Frankly, a fair amount of PS5 games don't really handle HDR that well to begin with, so this might be a non-issue.", "Tiene buena calidad de imagen y aunque puedes ver videos en 4k mas alla de esos videos no noto mucho la resolucion de la pantalla , no me mal entiendas se ve bien , pero no noto la calidad que deberia de tener en general , tal ves solo soy yo , me gusta mucho que se pueda rotar en varios grados subir y bajar la altura tiene bocinas integradas con baja potencia pero ya es algo por el precio , que parece que yo la agarre en oferta , si pagas mas de 8000 siento que ya no vale tanto la pena , pero de momento cumple con todo lo que un semi monitor gamer deberia ofrecer , contento con mi compra", "Muy buen producto, lo \u00fanico malo que yo puse opci\u00f3n a 12 meses sin intereses y me aparece como si el pago hubiera sido a contado, ojal\u00e1 me pudieran ayudar a ponerlo a meses sin intereses tal cual marca la publicaci\u00f3n", "Amazing quality and value, both games and YouTube looks amazing on this 4K screen, definitely worth the money.", "Soy un gamer casual , este monitor cumple con todo lo necesario para jugar en una Xbox series X , juegos como COD , Gear 5 , The Witcher de ven incre\u00edble.\n\nSi no eres un gamer de competencia no es necesario un s\u00faper monitor de 120hz y dem\u00e1s caracter\u00edsticas , a mi en lo personal me gusta el nivel de detalle , este monitor cumple perfectamente , tiene unos colores s\u00f3lidos y profundos ...\n\nEso si , tienen que configurar bien su Xbox o PS de manera que le saquen todo el provecho al monitor.", "Tiene una imagen estupenda es todo lo que promete y m\u00e1s. Altamente recomendable su precio es muy adecuado, te permite jugar en 4 K a 60 FPS", "Have you ever purchased something and was extremely pleased with yourself for purchasing the item? Well, that's how I feel about my purchase of this monitor. I'm not a geek but I how what I like and after months of investigating and finally choosing this monitor, I can say for the money spent, this is my best choice. The size is perfect for my ailing eyes. It has all the features I would want in a monitor and then some. It arrived brand new and well packaged. The only issue I have is the connection panel is located on the bottom in the rear and not on the side, which I prefer. So making my connections before placing it where I wanted it was a little challenging but successful. Once made, I don't see the need to move it until I swap out the HDMI cable for the Display Port cable for increased bandwidth.\nI used the HDMI connection first. The image right out of the box is pretty good and I didn't see the need to fiddle with the the features to get the best image possible just yet. I plan to research on the net to see how others dialed in their monitor for that great image they talk about here in the reviews. There are no dead pixels and the image just looks amazing thus far but It can and will do better. I am just happy to get the monitor set up. I have an Nvidia GTX 3070 display adapter that is more than adequate for this light gamer. I envision lots of fun to come and productivity accomplished with this monitor.\nHere's the thing. This is why I shop Amazon whenever possible. I purchased the monitor for the advertised price of $309. Two weeks later the price dropped to $249. Amazon made an exception and refunded me the difference. Now the price went up to $269 which is still a great price for this 28\" 4K monitor with HDR10 and an IPS panel @60hz. It's like playing the stock market. You've got to stay on top of it to get the best price. Thanks Amazon for allowing me a very good purchase.", "I actually loved this monitor. Yes, if I'm surfing the web and then start a game, whatever was on the screen prior, stayed as a shadow for about 10 minutes. But I could get over that. Unfortunately, it died 3 years and 2 weeks after I bought it. It went into constant power-on-off-on-off cycling and that was the end of it. Finally replaced it today. So, be on the look-out for screen burn-in lasting about 10 minutes from day one, and the possibility of a power cycle end at three years. But the screen itself was absolutely beautiful to look at. Everything was so vibrant and just popped.", "When it comes to monitors- I'm a fan of ASUS. In this picture that's VG28Q on the left and VP28UQG on the right. For my work setup it's probably an overkill- I could've gotten a cheaper 4k monitors. But I love how sharp the text is rendered at 200% in Windows, something that LG's 4K monitor has a hard time with.", "I bought this monitor about four months ago after having done 8+ hours of research. I knew I would be using it on a day to day basis for work (programming, document writing, excel spreadsheets), gaming on my xbox one s, and of course watching netflix like my picture shows. This meant I wanted good color articulation, detail for reading small text, at least a 60hz refresh rate, a decent refresh rate, good height, tilt, and rotation changing, and lastly I did not want it to be very deep since it is pushed up against a wall.\n\nBefore getting to the negative of this monitor, I would first like to cover what is good about it. The color articulation is quite fantastic. There are plenty of reviews online that go over optimal settings for certain tasks, such as how to adjust brightness, saturation, and which appearance profiles to use. Once I found a decent one, I haven't changed it since. It's kinda annoying to feel like I have to change it all the time when doing something different.\n\nBefore my usb-c to DisplayPort cable came in the mail for use with my 2019 macbook pro, I was using hdmi and the apple usb-c adapter. Let me tell you, the 30hz max achievable by the hdmi cord that comes with the monitor is dreadful. In this day and age, we are all very used to 60hz. You've gotta get a modern DisplayPort cable that supports 60hz at 4k resolution.\n\nI chose this monitor size because at a 4k resolution, a 28\" diagonal monitor is fewer pixels per inch than the crappy dell work computer I used over the summer which was about 13\" diagonal and 1080p. Anyways, since I wanted text readability to be preserved, I used some reviews online and realized this was the largest screen I would go for to preserve text clarity, and it is more than great. I actually would get this exact same size again. Any larger would be too big for my uses, since I sit with my face 2-3 ft away from the screen. Also, at this size and text clarity I will work on two python jupyter notebooks at once, write an email and have two chrome tabs open, or have three pdfs open (two of which I can read at a time), and that's not including my laptop screen.\n\nThe screen comes off the wall by 6.5 inches, and the furthest point which is on the base of the monitor comes out 9.5 inches. The monitor has very customizable movement settings, better than most I saw on the market. It's nice because it's very flexible, not that I change it much except for when I am plugging in cables in the back. Height is variable from 1.75 inches off the desk to 8.5 inches off the desk. Tilt, rotation, and cable management is also great.\n\nFinally for the downside. If you notice in the picture, the large brightspots at the bottom right and bottom left have been there since day one and have not / will not go away. They are only noticeable when the display is showing darker colors, and I have tried a bunch to edit the settings to make it go away but I haven't been able to. Honestly, I got over it after about a week. Let's be real, had I known these spots would be there I would not have purchased this exact monitor. Was it annoying enough to send it back and ask for another (which honestly would probably have the same defect?) No. Beware tho, this is what ~$350 get's you. Everything about this monitor was great except for this defect.\n\nMy ultimate suggestion: buy your monitor at an in-person store so that you can test a demo, even see if they will let you plug it in and try it before you walk out of the store. If you order from amazon, accept you might need to deal with sending it back, which is a pain in the ass for something so big and expensive.", "My so. Said not good enough for gaming. Ok to watch movies but we returned it to get a better gaming monitor", "This monitor is awesome and it arrived a day early.", "Great picture & sound. Well worth the price", "Using this monitor for image acquisition and the viewing angle with IPS is amazing.\n\nShame on ASUS for including the smallest power cable I've even seen for a monitor this size.\nYou've got about 6 inches max from the power box to the wall.

Crisp lines & details and deep, bright, accurate colour for design work. Flexible monitor - from portrait /landscape orientation - to height adjustment. Very stable on desk, easy to change monitor placement to accommodate Zoom vs design work.\n\nCons:\nIf you're going to make a monitor that has adjustable height & orientation, do not put the power etc. controls where we will grip the monitor to make those adjustments. One star off for this design.", "it works as well as you could hope. I got mine on sale and i'm very happy with it", "I've had this monitor for a few years now still works just like new. Only issue I had was with my Xbox series x which would periodically not detect freesync, the option would be greyed out in the Xbox settings to fix it all I would have to do is change the input to something else then back to the Xbox however this issue never occurred with my PC kind of suspect it's more of an issue with Xbox than the monitor. I use a high refresh rate monitor for PC and gaming now but I still use the monitor only now as my living room TV since it does have a really nice picture and outlived a $800 Sony TV that I bought at the same time as this monitor. Also I'm pretty picky about response time and input lag but none of those things have been an issue with this monitor.", "First thing I noticed is the smaller bezel on this monitor. As in, it shrunk by almost half on the top and sides of the display - compared to previous ASUS monitors. The on-screen menus are packed with a ton of features and goodies to adjust display performance.\n\nI use this with a Linux workstation and a Windows gaming rig. It works quite well.\n\nThe onscreen menus are packed! From GameVisual (gaming modes) to blue light filters to colors and images. There are a ton of things to tune display performance.\n\nOh, apparently ASUS managed to sneak in speakers on this monitor. (I don't use them so can't comment)\n\nThese monitors are a bargain and slot in nicely with dual-monitor arms/displays.\n\nI can't comment about higher end graphics features. I can say that I'm 100% happy with them and would buy more from ASUS.", "I've been using this monitor for over a year and decided to stop using my laptop screen as a second monitor and get another one of these. It's nice to have a matching set and much easier to use instead of having to zoom in on my 17\" laptop screen. Looks so good mounted side by side on the wall.", "I bought two of these monitors from Amazon Warehouse. One used Very Good and one used Like New. No problems with the Like New one. Even considering the MSRP on these is $300, paying over MSRP for a used one is still a great value to me honestly. The problem came with the Very Good one. Amazon warehouse guidelines say that Very Good has seen limited us and remains in good working conditions, may show some limited signs of wear and could be missing some accessories (but if missing will be listed). This one did not list any missing accessories. The page says new it comes with the monitor Display Port cable and power cable. The Like New one came with an HDMI cable which was surprising. However, the Very Good one came without a DP cable or HDMI cable. After getting the runaround by Amazon support (the first rep literally just rage quit the chat lol) I finally got a senior rep who agreed it was supposed to come with a DP cable and refunded me some money. I noticed a missing chunk out of the Very Good condition one. It looks like someone tried to peel the screen as there are two lines in the bezel as well. While Amazon did agree to do a return/refund, I will now have to pay for a New one at increased cost. The Very Good one also did not ship in original packaging (which was fine) but it shipped pre-assembled (base attached) and what appeared to me to be inadequate padding. Overall, as a product, I rate this monitor very highly, just be careful when buying Used even if it is from Amazon Warehouse. If you are planning to buy a used one as a gift, I would recommend opening it up and making sure it works so you can send it back in the 30 day window if necessary. Update: I then had to order a new one from NSpire Store. I can say the new one works great, however, my gripe is with the seller. I placed an order with them, then three days in they messaged me asking me to cancel my order because they did not have stock (against Amazons policy). I did so and the VERY next day they had 9 units in stock. However, look at that they increased the price. I messaged them asking if I could get the original price I had (when they told me to cancel the order) they said no. 10/10 great monitor, 7/10 for Amazon Warehouse and 3/10 for Nspire.", "The best monitor for this price. IPS panel is perfect. (innolux M280DCA-E3B)", "This is a great display and has high ratings for gaming across the web. My gaming is limited to flight simulation and I do not fly fast fighter jets, so I am not a likely reviewer to comment on some of the features of this monitor, like adaptive sync. The picture quality is outstanding and hi res stream video is incredible. I will use for work and play and I am enjoying the 4K UHD resolution. Nuff said.\n\nThe menu and menu controls I find excellent, especially compared to my previous monitor, also an ASUS, model MX279 (1080, which had \"hair-trigger\" menu controls that always frustrated me. This monitor is a world better in that regard.\n\nThere are some factors to be aware of with this monitor. Cable management is in my opinion poor. The ports are all vertical plug ins on a recessed under-ledge. First, I found it a pain to locate and plug in the DP and HDMI cables. I had to use a mirror and small flashlight and still found it difficult. The cables, once plugged in, extend downward and I can find no way to gather them other than from side to side in an opening at the back of the the base's upright. There is a snap on cover for the rear of the upright but it just holds the cables relatively tight to the upright but does not conceal them. I could train them directly behind the upright but then I would not use the side-to-side provision that ASUS provided.. And then....\n\nThe viewing surface of this monitor sits well forward above the base. A full 7-inches from the back edge of the base. So if you do not have a relatively deep desk or work/gaming surface you may not achieve a comfortable viewing distance. My desktop is 29-inches deep and I have it spaced 3 1/2-inches from the wall. To get a comfortable view distance I have the base slid all the way back to where the rear of the base contacts the wall. That does not produce a balance issue for me because of the monitor's front biased weight distribution. Just pointing this out for you to consider when evaluating the area where you will use it.\n\nSo. On that issue of training the cables directly behind the upright of the base..... I cannot because I need the base all the way back to the wall.\n\nJust things to consider.", "This is my first 4K monitor and I like the details it brings up with my computer and watching movies. I did lower my expectations when I ordered this monitor because it's not as expensive as others, but I'm pretty happy with the quality and the diverse and customizable themes (image settings) to fit variable purposes of the monitor. The image can be as good as in my MacBook Pro. I'm detail oriented, so my only disappointment is watching a movie that is pretty dark or the side is black because you still see 2 small white reflections coming from the edge of the screen (left side). The monitor is not broken because I noticed you can see a similar light coming from the edge of the TV as well, but my MacBook does not have that light. It could be just the type of material is made of. But in general, bright and dark image or high contrast images look great.\n\nThe place where the cables are connected are fine for me and the buttons to go through the menu options are also fine for me since I'm right-handed. I noticed some people complained about those things. I love you can rotate it to Portrait mode and the different tilt options. It's pretty flexible to fit whatever you are doing and whatever position you want.\n\nI'm adding 2 pictures here. In one, you'll see this monitor in portrait mode. On the other image, you'll see a black background and one of my pictures in the middle. You can see there the light I mentioned with black images on the left side in the middle and the lower left. You can ignore the top left because that's a reflection from my window. If you change position, you don't see that light. Most people don't mind a minor thing like that, but I'm just being honest that it's there. My TV does something similar when the movie has a lot of black areas, so I know it is normal.", "I got this at a deep discount as a renewed display from Amazon Warehouse.\nThis is the 2nd display of this model I have now.\nThe display is excellent and other than it was not in the original box, its as new.\nAll the pixels are good, the display body looks as new.\nIt came with all the accessories and the manual.\nIt was packages with the original made to fit styrofoam so it was well protected and well packaged.", "I love this monitor! It has a great, sharp picture, the HDR is off the charts, and the response time is quick. I gave it overall 4 stars because there are just 3 things that I am not the biggest fan of. I don't knock it too hard though because this is a fairly cheap 4k 60fps HDR 28 inch monitor.\n\n1. The speakers in the monitor are awful but that isn't a huge deal for me as I hook it up to separate speakers anyway. I would not recommend relying on the monitor speakers as your main source of sound.\n\n2. Changing sources can be a bit of a chore as there is not a dedicated source button on the back. You have to enter the menu and then a sub menu to get to sources. Sort of inconvenient for me who switches between my computer and xbox all the time. Not a deal breaker by any means, but it could be better.\n\n3. When in HDR mode, if there is unoccupied screen, meaning you're watching a movie or cinematic in wide screen, the edges of the monitor have a very soft and subtle under glow. THIS DOES NOT EFFECT THE PICTURE QUALITY. It only is present when there is no image at all on the top and bottom. The blacks in a picture in HDR mode are very much dark and black. Its just around the edges, I tried capturing an image but it was so subtle I couldn't quite capture it. I am not too upset about this because I know this is an entry level HDR monitor. If this was a thousand dollar monitor I would probably be more upset about it.\n\nOverall I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend this monitor to any gamer looking to dip there toes into 4k HDR gaming.", "I thought for sure my monitor was broken because I literally heard the driver drop the box at my door. They dropped it from enough height that I was able to hear it from the laundry room with both the washer and dryer on. Fortunately it was a box withing a box and the box from Asus was very well padded!\n\nI've been using it daily for two weeks as a I am still in WFH mode, which means this monitor is always on or in sleep mode. I'm running it in a dual monitor set up paired up with and old Dell 4k monitor fed by a laptop from USB C ports and have had no issues with flickering or not getting 3840x2160 resolution out of it. People are always quick to blame monitors but always check the stuff down stream and make sure you always use good cables!! So far not dead pixels or black bands or any other issue that everyone else seems to be having. two thing I disliked immediately. Cable management is non existent all you get is a cheapo cover that sort of helps route cables! It also doesn't plug in directly it requires a power brick that comes with a short three prong extension to plug into the wall. I'm replacing that cable with a longer one so I can move the brick off the floor.\n\nUPDATE\nI now have two of these monitors no dead pixels on either one. I did break the latch that holds the part that is used for the minimal cable management that is provided with the monitor stand. Also the speaker on this monitor is absolutely terrible, but it's a monitor not a sound system.\n\nUpdate Jan 2022\nstill no issues!", "I have purchased Asus monitor in the past and was pretty pleased with it. I decided to buy this after looking at a few other brands and seeing a review video from someone who was also using it primarily for design. I am not a gamer so I won't really have any feedback relevant to those looking for a gaming monitor.\n\nOverall the image and clarity on the monitor is really crisp and sharp, colors are generally well saturated, and the monitor settings allow for some fine tuning of your image. As a designer, I am very adept at color calibration and my one gripe with the monitor is that its almost impossible to get a pure white. I have it connected to a Macbook Pro and with it sitting side by side, there is a noticeable difference in the whites on my Mac vs the TUF monitor. Even after adjusting color settings and trying all of the viewing presets, I can only get a dull off-white or blue tinted white. Its *almost* bad enough that I considered finding another monitor and sending this one back, but I decided to give a few weeks and see how my eyes adjust or if it affects my work. I don't know if it is just the specific unit I have or if this is common to all TUF monitors, but I wouldn't recommend if color accuracy is important.", "I like this monitor, but it has some issues:\n\nColor: I bought two of this monitor for a dual setup. The color doesn't match between the two and it's been a huge hassle tweaking RGB settings trying to get them to match. I even have a monitor calibration tool (ColorMunki) and it still couldn't get them to match exactly. I get it, it's not an expensive monitor. I can't expect perfection. But factory color calibration of some sort would be nice.\n\nSettings: When HDR is enabled, you have almost no control over monitor settings. However, it appears that the settings selected when not in HDR mode still apply. This makes no sense to me. Imagine having to disable HDR, tweak whatever settings you want to tweak (contrast, color temp, etc) and then enabling HDR to see what effect it has. Then switching back to SDR to make more changes. It's insanity. If it wasn't for the fact that the color doesn't match between the two I have, maybe tweaking the monitor settings wouldn't be necessary. But I've basically given up on trying to use HDR for my normal computer usage. Only my Xbox Series X uses HDR mode on this monitor now, which is a bummer.\n\nControls: I'm getting used to them, but I really hate the control placement on these monitors. It's especially inconvenient when you have a dual monitor setup. Since you can't reach the left monitor's controls from the side, you have to reach from underneath, which is not ideal. There is plenty of room for downward-facing controls on the bottom of the monitor.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with these monitors, but not ecstatic.", "* I purchased this for gaming(Xbox 1X & PS4 Pro to be specific) and wanted to upgrade from an older 24\" LG 4K monitor I purchased in 2017. * After spending a bit tweaking the settings(using the \"racing\" preset as my basis), I'm very pleased with the monitor. The colors are very vivid and make the LG look pale in comparison. *The built in speakers are not bad, but I still use a 2.1 PC sound system for better bass.\n*Cons: For most games, the HDR makes the colors look washed out and the image softer. I spent a while adjusting the HDR settings in my Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, and always found the games looked better after turning HDR on the consoles. Unfortunately, you can't turn it off on the monitor itself. These 350 nit monitors just don't get bright enough for real HDR. *The placement of the HDMI inputs makes it a pain to insert them, but I expect that with most monitors/televisions anyways. *All in all, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this monitor to anyone with an Xbox One or PS4 Pro(can't speak from experience for anything else, but I'm sure it is awesome for PC gamers as well). I give it a 4.5 out of 5.", "I tried the 1000 dollar Aorus 4k among other more expensive monitors, all in an effort to work with my budget 4k PC and future proof for when, one day, I get a PS5 (though who knows when that will be).\n\nI settled on this because I realized anything under $1500 has horrible HDR that locks all settings and looks horrible. So I bought this as a last result and I was very impressed. I don't know how well this week workwork with the PS5, because this HDR stinks on those one too, but I don't even have one and if I can wait till next year, all the prices will drop on this year's models, so this I view as relatively temporary, but at $300+ that's fine if I'm in the market for something good but not a million bucks.\n\nAs for this monitor, I got the picture (without HDR) to look as good as the Aorus using dynamic contrast as well as my skills at tuning screens, which had become a bit of an amateur hobby. Comment if you want my settings, and I'll try to see it and comment back with all relevant numbers.\n\nAll in all, the picture of this monitor rocks without HDR and with the right tuning it looks AMAZING! If you want to spend over 1000 bucks you'll probably get something better, but if you don't want to spend that much, get this, and never turn on HDR, and don't get sold on a company's bold claims on their $500 monitor in regard to their HDR capabilities.", "I bought this monitor for the 4K resolution so I could see more on the screen when I needed to as an upgrade from my 1080p screen. It looks great! The colors are good and image quality is good. It's a solid productivity monitor.\n\nThis is being sold as a gaming monitor and this is where it's lacking. I used this with my RTX 3080 and I was still seeing screen tearing occur with G-Sync. It is not certified G-Sync compatible but there were claims it works... just not well imo. Another issue was the sound quality coming out of the monitor is the worst I've heard from a built-in speaker. When gaming, I usually use headphones so it's not a big deal. However, when I am watching videos, I use the monitor speakers. It seems to help in Windows 10 to turn on Windows Sonic for Headphones. It seems to drop the tinniness just a bit. Lastly, the refresh rate is limited to 60 Hz at all resolutions. This is very low for resolutions 1080p and less for gaming. I don't play a lot of \"e-sport\" titles so twitch reflexes aren't so important but if i were doing some competitive FPS I'd be extremely disappointed.", "Really great monitor 4K for pretty cheap, looks great and works great", "Bought it to use with my PS5 and Xbox Series X. Couldn't be happier with the picture quality and performance. My days of gaming on a big living room tv are over! Really satisfied with the clarity and refresh rate in first person shooter games (warzone, battlefield, apex) and RPGs (hogwarts legacy, assassins creed, destiny). The speakers in the monitor aren't the best (sounds like a tin can). However most people will probably use a headset if console gaming.", "I purchased the ASUS TUF Gaming VG289Q 28\u201d HDR Gaming Monitor to be used with my Xbox. It's in a small corner of my camper so it couldn't be too big. This monitor is just the right size. So far it has been functioning superbly. The graphics are amazing and all the features/settings are a great bonus.\n\nMy only complaint is that the speakers are terrible! The sound is very tinny and there is no bass whatsoever. Therefore, I added a TaoTronics TT-SK028 Computer Speaker Soundbar. The sound quality is MUCH better. I mounted it at the bottom of the monitor. However, after doing so the monitor would not stay raised and kept sliding down. Unfortunately, there is no way to adjust the torsion so that it remains raised. To fix it I just used a velcro strap.\n\nOverall this is a great monitor, but I had to knock off a star because of the sound quality. I would definitely recommend it for gaming or with a desktop/laptop.\n\nNOTE: I purchased the TaoTronics TT-SK028 Computer Speaker Soundbar from Amazon at the same time, but for some reason it is no longer available.", "Amazing monitor, that being said\u2026 the only thing I dislike about this monitor is the fact that even when having to volume on 1 it sounds hardly any different from having the volume on 30", "Looks like I\u2019m the first to write a review on Amazon for this item! I wanted a solid monitor mainly for casual console gaming that checked all the boxes at a decent price. I was very close to getting the Asus MG28UQ but since this is newer tech I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did!\n-\nThe order arrived the next day as indicated, thank you Amazon. The packaging was very good, no damage of any kind. The assembly was extremely easy all I had to do was insert the base and twist the screw at the bottom, no tools of any kind required. I was kinda disappointed that it didn\u2019t include a HDMI cable. I have a really good one either way but it would\u2019ve been nice to have another for backup. Included with my order was the monitor, display port, power supply and manual. I quickly got it set up and was ready to go.\n-\nOut of the box it looked gorgeous, I made some minor tweaks and was ready to play! I\u2019m coming from a QHD monitor with a lower response time and wasn\u2019t expecting the same performance with this monitor as I mainly bought it for visuals, I was wrong. This monitor handles fast paced gaming very well I was blown away. I played Modern Warfare on my X1X and didn\u2019t miss a beat coming from my larger monitor with better response times.\n-\nI\u2019m very happy with my purchase and will continue to look for Asus products in the future. This monitor should even be good for next gen with the series X, I look forward to keeping it for the years to come!", "This Monitor is good when it works. Unfortunately there is serious UI downgrades from their previous models, such as no dedicated button to switch inputs, you have to hold a menu button to get there and it takes too long. Additionally, the monitor has a terrible input system that is bad at connecting to inputs and turning on when an input is feeding signal. Half the time it works, and half the time it doesnt see the signal until you switch to Display Port and back to HDMI. Originally I had such a hard time getting the monitor to accept a signal that I sent it in for repairs. BEWARE. they found a spec of dried spit (most likely) on my screen and attempted to charge me more than the cost of the monitor to fix the input issue because of this spec. After 5-6 emails complaining that my issue wasnt with a spec on the screen, but rather the monitor not accepting signal, they agreed to fix just the motherboard in it which had a faulty input component. After fixing it, they reported that the input issue was fixed, but that it now the monitor was flickering, and they would have to charge me more than the price of the monitor to send it back to me. You see where this is going? Yes, another 10-11 emails back and forth, escalating to the \"CEO\"s office email accounts and complaining and threatening legal action against them is what it took for them to fix the screen and send me the monitor back at no additional charge. I had to explain to them that I had it in writing from them that the monitor flicker was not present before they fixed the input issue, and that issue was caused by their fix. Absolute insanity. This took about 3 months to resolve. DO NOT under any circumstances buy ASUS products. I've bought three monitors from them. First one had a screen defect and I had to get repaired, this is the third and I had the issues above. They are faulty products, and if there is even a single slight scratch, or scuff, or spec of dried spit on it, they will attempt to charge you for a complete fix of whatever is scuffed, and will attempt to not budge until you either eat the cost of shipping both ways and accept no repairs, or pay them more than the cost of what you bought it for to fix the monitor. Its criminal customer service. Go look ASUS warranty, or repair, on reddit or google and read all the horror stories. Do not support this terrible company.", "I just compared a video on another monitor, and was so inspired I logged in here just to review this monitor real quick. Admittedly, I am coming from bad monitors. I've got one of those squarish dell monitors, which I can tweak a little bit to get 2560x2048. The 'monitor' I was upgrading from is a 720p samsung television.\n\nBut this monitor, for the price point, is everything I could ask for and much more. Things I didn't even know I needed. Height adjustable, swivel left/right/up/down. Looks really sleek. Considerably thin bezel. No dead pixels I've noticed. Ive used for about 2 weeks. Its got different modes for different viewing subjects, movies, fps, racing, etc. It's got an adjustable center dot/crosshair, which I didn't even know was a thing monitors these days do, but it makes aiming a cinch and gives me an edge I definitely didn't have before. Playing RDR2 was awe-inspiring. I am using \"scenery mode\" which seems to provide eye-popping contrast and makes everything look lush and vivid.\n\nI don't remember if this is IPS or what but its certainly got the lumens and the saturation, the definition, lack of bleed, just everything about this I am so impressed with. But again, this was a huge upgrade for me so I can't really compare it honestly to its competition, except to say this was one of the cheapest 4k monitors that didn't seem like total crap, and I am a happy camper.", "So, this monitor is very nice in terms of aesthetics and functionality. The resolution is good, color is good and it even comes with a built in speaker at the base. For all the nice features the only catch is the refresh rate. Its 60hz so I guess its good for the price considering the size of quality of the monitor overall. Honestly I bought this by mistake, I was looking at several monitors and overlooked the refresh rate, but considering the overall quality and the fact Im only looking for a second monitor it pays the bill. If you really want the picture quality and cant afford a monitor of this size and resolution with 144hz then this is perfect for you. High refresh rate is only important for gaming, where Gamers want to see the smoothness of motion while playing, so don\u2019t take this the wrong way when I criticize the refresh rate; This monitor is excellent for gaming if refresh rate isn\u2019t very important to you. So far this monitor has worked flawlessly, I highly recommend to casual or budget gamers, or someone looking for a 4k res 2nd monitor.", "Great monitor for use with my astronomy cameras. Allows me to see better details of the deep sky images I capture. Worth every penny. I mean for the price this is one great monitor.", "I have a new Asus 4k HDR laptop and bought this monitor to go with it. I had high hopes for what my experience would be combining 2 of their newer products together with supposedly complementary features and specs.\n... Nope.\n\nFrom the first hookup, the HDR certification for the monitor was not recognized by windows like it should have been, and would not allow the HDR setting to be turned on. So I bought a 4k HDR monitor to use with a 4k HDR laptop from the same company, that not only can't use HDR but isn't even recognized as being valid. ... From the same company.\n\nI contacted Asus customer service and was given the runaround from the beginning. They provided literally no even troubleshooting to try to determine what the problem was. Instead, it was supposedly escalated to a higher tier of support and handed off to someone else who would get back to me in 24-48 hours.\n\nReally what that higher tier amounts to is receiving a stock email asking me questions that I already answered in the initial call, and really have nothing to do with the problem I'm having. It's form letter customer service to the highest (or lowest I guess) degree. On top of that, after towing and be saying that it wasn't addressing my issue, now every two or three days I'll receive an email asking me a question (usually one I've already answered) and then telling me if I have further issues to check their knowledge base.\n\nEven though supposedly somebody was supposed to call me to help me try to troubleshoot the problem, all I get are the one question emails. I've complained repeatedly replying to the emails, but still they keep coming and no real customer support ever actually does. I would strongly urge staying away from buying from Asus whatever you do. And definitely don't buy the extended warranties from them because you're going to pay to get treated terribly.\n\nThe problem still exists and I'm left with no choice really but to return this model. I'm just waiting for the Black Friday deals to hit so I can get a replacement monitor from a company that hopefully actually cares about their customers.\n\nBy the way, for the record, I've been using computers and work with them most of every day for the better part of 2+ decades. I've built my own machines many times. I'm definitely computer literate and familiar with all sorts of different troubleshooting steps, methods, and tools. They were all tried before contacting Asus support. If this is the level of support frustration that I'm getting, I would hate to see what someone without my experience would go through.\n\nDon't buy ANYTHING from Asus if you want to be taken care of as a customer.", "Picture quality is pretty good! The presets like Scenery, Racing, Cinema, RTS/RPG, etc. modes give you a variety to choose from. If you want to save your own picture settings, you can do that too! My only gripes are: 1) If it would have been 120hz or more, I would have given it 5 stars \u2b50...BUT for the price and what Asus could do to keep it fair, I had to accept the 60hz for gaming. 2) Sometimes in dark scenes, one can see noise but it might be due to older films that get upscaled or the device on which the video is shot--so 4.8 stars is about right. Also for a monitor being ranked in the 40s - 50s out of the thousands of monitors, it is reassuring! I'll get a 4K monitor with a higher refresh rate when the prices drop in the future. I tried the 2K monitors at 144hz or more, but the picture quality and quality wasn't like this monitor! So far, no dead pixels or burns so I'm pleased with it.", "The monitor works great and looks very good right out of the box with little tuning. The menu is easy to navigate and it has some pretty good presets to use as well. The only few things I don\u2019t like is the monitor is very bright and can have a washed out look to it in certain games. The other issue is the HDR just doesn\u2019t look the best, especially when areas in games look washed out.\n\nAll in all the monitor is great if you want a 4k 60hz monitor that looks fantastic (excluding hdr) and is 28\u201d for sub $500. If you want something with more bells and whistles then you\u2019ll have to be willing to spend a lot more.", "", "If you're using a MacBook and you want your colors to match you'll have a hard time. I find the biggest issue is with mid-warm colors like shades of purple and pink. I've been messing with the RGB settings (which are buried in Color -> Color Temp. -> User Mode) and can't get a good balance which allows purples to look like purple and not blue, and getting the grey window borders to look grey and not kind of pink.\n\nHowever, as a standalone monitor you'll probably never notice the difference. I use an external monitor to extend my MacBook display for work, and as a standalone for my Xbox. While working I'll be constantly shifting focus between the two displays. I found a setting that should be OK for now, but I'll probably end up handing this down to my daughter or selling it and buying an LG Ultrafine display when they're more readily available, even though they're more expensive and require an adapter for non-Apple devices.\n\nBesides color, I think the display itself looks great. It has a matte display but it's not grainy at all like some cheaper matte displays tend to be. Despite having a hard time calibrating the color, the colors are nice and there are a lot of settings available to adjust to your preferences. I do think it's too bright and lowering the brightness effects the hue too much.", "Full disclaimer: I am not a professional PC gamer/photo editor/anything of the like. Nor am I a tech genius that can compare every monitor by the most specific numbers. I AM however a PS4 pro gamer and have been slowly making changes to my gaming experience (new headset, kontrolfreeks, and now a gaming monitor). I researched for monitors for maybe a solid month and it came down to this and the BENQ EL2870U. I went for this one and couldn\u2019t be happier with my decision.\n\nI mostly play COD: Warzone and for FPS games it works for me. With the PS5 coming out I think 4K and 60hz will do fine (although PS5 rumored to push 120hz).\n\nThe picture quality is great, ergonomics are great although I don\u2019t move it much, and the monitor itself looks good and is light but feels durable. There are a number of features and visual presets to help you tailor the settings towards whatever you\u2019re doing.\n\nIf there was one area I would say this monitor lacks is in sound quality as the speakers leave much to be desired but wasn\u2019t a big deal to me because I use a headset anyways. I don\u2019t have the means to test the exact input lag but it\u2019s very responsive to me compared a Samsung monitor I had originally, and especially compared to a TV.\n\nFor console gaming I would highly recommend this monitor. For PC or for future PC users this monitor probably won\u2019t serve you well.", "As a serious armature Photoshop user, I'm quite pleased at the ability of this IPS monitor to display colors. At this price range, it's rare to see 90% DCI-P3 color space, which is well beyond the sRGB color space on most other monitors. For those who think I'm speaking alien, DCI-P3 is what you see in movie theaters right now, and is supported in most newer phones and tablets.\n\nA simple test is to drag the same photo between my older DELL monitor (which is also IPS type) and this ASUS VG289Q. Note that I have a dual monitor setup. I can see colors and details in areas that the DELL shows as black. I used the color sampler tool in Photoshop and verified that the color in this shadow area is indeed not supposed to be black. In mid tones, colors on the ASUS is also more vivid without being over-saturated.\n\nIf I need to print, which is rare nowadays, I can switch to sRGB mode and check the colors there. The sRGB mode has one flaw, is that the brightness can't be adjusted. It's a bit too bright for the ambient light in my room.\n\nMovies are eye candy as well. Text look sharp due to 4K pixel density.\n\nCheck out glowing technical reviews on Tomshardware and DisplayNinja.", "I am just a casual PC gamer. I bought this for a crisper text and trying out 4K UHD HDR content. I don't have a 4K TV, wanted to see how the movies look UHD HDR.\nI got the crisp and clear text I needed. It is easier on my eyes too. It is bright enough that there is a nice difference when I turn on HDR.\nAt first the color was just too extreme, it was ridiculous and after long adjustments, it is fantastic now. Yes, you have to turn off HDR to adjust, then turn it back on again. BTW, there is no screen issues, yay!\nI am connected via display port and have a gtx 1070 grafics card. Prime does not recognize it for UHD content, their loss of my money. Yes, I tried with a HDMI cable too but no go from Prime nor YouTube movies. But normal Youtube 4K content shows and shows amazingly.\nMovies, pictures look amazing on it. I am spoiled, I don't want to watch anything in 1080P anymore. The difference is stunning. I am very happy with the HDR on this, anything brighter would blow my eyes.\nI am loving and enjoying it.", "Nice picture quality. I have had issues with windows 10 going to shut off the monitors and one of them will get stuck in a on off loop and do this Indefinitely. I then had lines on the screen but they went away after restarting the computer. One annoying problem is the cable cover on the back doesn't work. It won't latch. It really only worked for the first few times. So I've had to tape it. For the price of these monitors I would expect a little better quality.", "I side by side tested this display against the similarly priced LG 27GL83A-B. I was trying to decide what I preferred more: fast response time or 4K. The decision wound up being an easy one but not for reasons I had thought of. This monitor has extremely deep, contrasty, and saturated colors, almost to the point of feeling kinda sugary and overcooked. I just didn't like it. I can see how some folks might prefer it because it does really pop but to my eyes it was way too much. It didn't feel natural to me.\n\nOverall the 5ms response time was snappy but I definitely noticed that it was less smooth, and the 4K just doesn't do much over 1440p. At a certain point it seems more about how the device processes and renders the pixels rather than how many pixels are on the screen, and to my eyes the LG looked better in every way. Another downside to this monitor is it is really big and heavy. I know it has \"Tuf\" in the name but I don't really need that in a display.\n\nThree stars because it is a quality item but for me the choice was clear.", "The most surprising thing about this monitor is that it is branded for gaming. It's a very bright IPS 4k display with HDR. It has an excellent stand and can be articulated many different ways. The bezel is very thin. I've bought 2 for a side by side configuration, and I see no screen irregularities in either of them. I use them for work and for some light gaming. I general, I would expect a gaming monitor to support a higher than 60Hz refresh rate and these do not. It does support Freesync/Adaptive Sync, but it's only over a 40-60Hz range, so it's of limited usefulness. Nevertheless, if High quality 60Hz gaming is your thing, this monitor will fit the bill. It also has a speaker for those limited office applications. Sound is \"tinny\" but I consider any speaker a bonus in a monitor like this. As long as you are not expecting high refresh rates common in gaming monitors, this one is an excellent choice.", "Love these great for gaming!", "I bought this monitor to replace a 10 year old 1080p display and have been thrilled with it so far. For gaming, I'm currently using a Xbox One X on it, and I wanted a monitor ready for the Xbox Series X and PS5. It's clear the developers for the next generation will be focused more on consistently hitting 4k/60fps, and hitting +120fps will be an exception rather than the norm.\n\nThe IPS Panel looks great and provides a very nice picture. The adjustable stand with tilt and built in speakers are a nice addition at this price point.\n\nMy biggest gripe so far has been adjusting the volume. I really wish they'd given the volume adjustment a dedicated physical button on the side of the monitor. Instead, the volume setting is part of the on screen settings display, and it's buried a few levels down. It's also incredibly slow to adjust the level up & down. To go from 0 to 100 takes almost 10 seconds!\n\nI had to buy a set of external speakers that have a physical knob on them, which I wasn't expecting to need, but it fixed the issue.", "We got two of these to use for our gaming tvs and it works great!

They are clearly not \"used acceptable\" because they do not properly function.\n\nThe fact that all 3 have the same problem leads me to believe this is a known issue. My guess is that the seller (which is surprisingly amazon in this case) is hoping folks buy them and just use HDMI. However, the fact that they are not stable with display port means there is something wrong with them, and even with just HDMI they may not last.", "Best monitor I've purchased to date.

Also, I was hesitant on the non-1ms because this doesn't look to be 1 ms, but I'll tell you, it didn't matter, at least not for me. Game play is very smooth and the way it plays is very unnoticeable. I have a one ms monitor any ways so it's not a big deal and again, it's not even noticeable. I recommend this monitor once again! I love watching videos in 4k now!", "I honestly never bought into the hype of using monitors for gaming/etc until last year. I bought my first monitor it was a Samsung monitor that supported 1080p, and it worked out well for me, but recently my friend convinced me to buy this, after being hesitant at first, it is the single greatest purchase I made in the last many years. My gameplay is flawless, the monitor is very mobile, can turn in any direction you can think of. The built in speakers are loud enough, but the display itself and how well it tracks your movement and gameplay is unmatched. Absolutely brilliant monitor, worth every penny. If you're thinking about getting a cheaper one, trust me, DON'T! My old monitor was $200 and it was awful compared to this. The extra 100 bucks is well worth it!", "The picture quality is as amazing as expected from a 4k monitor. Crystal clear and sharp detail. What surprised me the most though is the color accuracy. I have a dual monitor setup, another Asus Tuf at that, but it's 1080p, and the color doesn't even compare. Everything is just so much more vibrant and how it should be on this monitor. Highly recommend, especially for photo/video editing or console gaming.", "Before this monitor I was gaming with a 1080p panel and I did not think the picture quality would be that much better in 4K. I was wrong. For under $400, I think this is possibly the best bang for the buck 4K monitor you can get. The picture quality and colors look fantastic. I am using this monitor for my ps5 and I could not be happier. The HDR is not too much better than SDR, but unless you are looking to spend 3x the price it is more than good enough. 60hz does not bother me as I do not believe that games on the ps5 will be able to achieve 4K 120fps for a while. The stand on this monitor is amazing as well, super customizable. Overall a great purchase.", "This monitor shines when displaying 4k 60 Hz content. Where it falls short is when displaying content which is natively below 4K. The monitor's own upscaling comes off as very blurry. As well, considering that it doesn't meet the actual requirements for VESA HDR, it's a bit misleading to call it HDR. It does have two different HDR modes, but annoyingly the brightness cannot be adjusted within those modes (or any other features, for that matter). That makes this monitor non-ideal for gaming in a dark room.", "I searched for weeks before I decided to buy this monitor. It's awesome. I don't game on it regularly, but I tried the PS5 on it for fun and it looks great. I don't play online games that require a super fast refresh rate (240 Hz), so I cannot comment on that. I think for even the conniseur, this will be insane. I think the picture quality is far beyond what is even available from most streaming/online platforms. I had to look up \"4K\" on youtube to find a video that highlighted the colors and it really impressed me.", "I'm not a gamer so I can't say if it's good for games or not.\nIt's working well as my computer screen though.", "Mostly for PS4 pro/PS5. Excellent 4k image quality. Great for regular gaming. The default color settings and game modes are fantastic. Fluid and beautiful colors overall. 28 inch is massive if you're in front of it. However the HDR is terrible and washed out and seem flat. When HDR is enabled the settings are locked. Dynamic contrast is on by default and there are only gaming HDR or cinema HDR mode. It's immediately appearant. Somewhat disappointed since I bought this monitor specifically for HDR and PS5. Still a great value but do not buy this for HDR.", "Even with the brightness set to zero, and the contrast turned extremely low (approximately 30-ish), screen images will remain--especially if you left something like a very bright white website on your screen. What makes this particularly egregious is that it doesn't even take very long for this to happen. I've left websites on the monitor for an hour or two while working on other things on another monitor, and the image will already be burned in.\n\nTo be fair, this *can* be fixed by rapidly flashing the screen black and white for a few hours, but still--I shouldn't have to do this because I left a website on my screen for a couple of hours. I have 2 other monitors from different manufacturers on different machines which have been left on overnight by mistake, and still no image persistence happens. But this one? Only takes an hour or two, and that's at zero brightness, and very low contrast. This is unacceptable.\n\nAs for the other facets of the monitor, everything else is fine. Picture quality is fantastic, lots of settings you can tweak, etc. For gaming, it's a great monitor. For actual day-to-day use for doing work... terrible. Avoid it like the plague."]}
