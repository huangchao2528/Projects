# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains my work on the Titanic survival prediction competition from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes passenger information like age, sex, ticket class, and whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Files in the Repository
- `Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
- `train.csv`: Training data set containing features and target variable.
- `test.csv`: Test data set used for making predictions.
- `submission.csv`: Predictions generated by the model, formatted for Kaggle submission.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and data cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistics to understand the data.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models based on accuracy and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuning the models to find the best parameters.

## Results
Got a 77.272% accuracy in my first attempt.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
